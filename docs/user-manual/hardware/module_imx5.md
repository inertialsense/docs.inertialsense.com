## Application

### Serial Interface

The following schematic demonstrates a typical setup for the IMX-5 module. A rechargeable lithium backup battery enables the GNSS to perform a warm or hot start. If no backup battery is connected, VBKUP (pin 3) should be connected to VCC and the module will perform a cold start on power up. If the system processor is not capable of updating the IMX firmware, it is recommended to add a header to an alternate IMX serial port for firmware updates via an external computer. The reset line is not necessary for typical use.

The following are recommended components for the typical application. Equivalent or better components may be used.

### SPI Interface

The SPI interface is enabled by holding the pin 10 low during boot up.

## Manufacturing
### Soldering

The IMX-5 can be reflow soldered. Reflow information can be found in the [Reflow Information](reflow.md) page of this manual.

### Tape Packaging

The IMX-5 modules are available in **cut tape** as well as **tape and reel** packaging.  The follow image shows the feed direction and illustrates the orientation of the IMX-5 module on the tape:

![IMX-5 Tape](images/IMX_Tape.png)
The feed direction to the pick and place pick-up is shown by the orientation of the IMX-5 pin 1 location. With pin 1 location on the bottom of the tape, the feed direction into the pick and place pick-up is from the reel (located to the right of the figure) towards the left.

The dimensions of the tapes for the IMX-5 are shown in the drawing below:

<!-- ### Reels
The GPS-1 modules are delivered in quantities of 100 pieces on a reel. -->

## Hardware Design

### Recommend PCB Footprint and Layout

A single ceramic 100nF decoupling capacitor should be placed in close proximity between the Vcc and GND pins. It is recommended that this capacitor be on the same side of the PCB as the IMX and that there not be any vias between the capacitor and the Vcc and GND pins. The default forward direction is indicated in the PCB footprint figure and on the IMX shield as the X axis. The forward direction is reconfigurable in software as necessary.
