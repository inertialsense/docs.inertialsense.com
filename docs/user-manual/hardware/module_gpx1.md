## Pinout

The GPX-1 module footprint and pinout similar that of the IMX-5 such that the common power and interface pins are at the same location.  The GPX-1 is extended to accommodate additional GNSS inputs and output.  The GPX-1 is designed to work in conjunction with the IMX-5.

![GPX-1 IMX-5 Layout](images/gpx1_imx5_layout_3d.png)

## Layout Guidance

### GNSS_RF Trace

The GNSS_RF trace should be designed to work in the combined GNSS L1 + L5 signal band.

For FR-4 PCB material with a dielectric permittivity of for example 4.2, the trace width for the 50 Î© line impedance can be calculated.

A grounded co-planar RF trace is recommended as it provides the maximum shielding from noise with adequate vias to the ground layer.

The RF trace must be shielded by vias to ground along the entire length of the trace and the ZEDF9P RF_IN pad should be surrounded by vias as shown in the figure below.

## Design Guidance

### Backup Battery

For achieving a minimal Time To First Fix (TTFF) after a power down (warm starts, hot starts), make sure to connect a backup battery to V_BCKP.

- Verify your battery backup supply can provide the battery backup current specified in the ZEDF9P datasheet.
- Allow all I/O including UART and other interfaces to float/high impedance in battery backup mode (battery back-up connected with VCC removed).

### RF Front-end Circuit Options

!!! important
    Active antenna(s) are required for the GPX-1.

## Soldering

The GPX-1 can be reflow soldered. Reflow information can be found in the [Reflow Information](reflow.md) page of this manual.

## Hardware Design

### Recommend PCB Footprint and Layout

A single ceramic 100nF decoupling capacitor should be placed in close proximity between the Vcc and GND pins. It is recommended that this capacitor be on the same side of the PCB as the GPX and that there not be any vias between the capacitor and the Vcc and GND pins.
