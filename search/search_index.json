Overview \u00b6 IMX (IMU, AHRS, and GPS-INS) \u00b6 The IMX \u2122 family of sensors are 10-DOF sensor modules consisting of a tactical grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), magnetometer, and barometer. Output includes angular rate, linear acceleration, magnetic vector, and barometric pressure and altitude. IMU calibration consists of bias, scale factor, cross-axis alignment, and temperature compensation. The IMX sensors include Attitude Heading Reference System ( AHRS ) sensor fusion to estimate roll, pitch, and heading. Adding GNSS input to an IMX enables onboard Inertial Navigation System ( INS ) sensor fusion for roll, pitch, heading, velocity, and position. The RUGGED series of products include a rugged aluminum enclosure, RS232, RS485, and CAN bus to the IMX. The RUGGEED RTK series include a multi-frequency GNSS receiver with RTK precision position enabling INS sensor fusion for roll, pitch, heading, velocity, and position. The RUGGED DUAL series include two multi-frequency GNSS receivers with RTK precision position and/or dual GNSS heading/compass. The Inertial Sense SDK is an open-source software development kit for quick integration to configure and communicate with Inertial Sense products.

The IRBS represents the IMU stability during benign conditions (i.e. ideal integration time, stable temperature, and no inertial motion). IEEE-STD-952-1997 defines IRBS as the minima on the Allan Variance curve. The following plots identify the Allan Variance representation of four IMX-5 tactical grade IMUs (serial numbers 60071, 60079, 60112, and 60114). Why the name change from uINS to IMX ? \u00b6 The name IMX means inertial measurement device with extensible capabilities. IMX is a derivative of the acronym IMU . Our flagship product was named the uINS which means miniature Inertial Navigation System (INS). This name has helped others to recognize the inertial navigation functionality. However, we felt that a more generic name would better cover all of the various functionality and capabilities contained in the IMX , namely: Tactical grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Barometer and magnetometer sensors Vertical Reference Unit (VRU) Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) GNSS aided Inertial Navigation System (GNSS-INS or GPS-INS) RTK-GNSS aided INS Dual-GNSS (GPS compassing) aided INS Ground vehicle Dead Reckoning system What is Inertial Navigation? \u00b6 Inertial navigation is a technique of estimating position, velocity, and orientation (roll, pitch, heading) by integrating IMU inertial motion data from gyros and accelerometers to continuously calculate the dead reckoning position. The inertial sensors are supplemented with other sensors such as GPS, altimeter, and magnetometer. Inertial navigation is commonly used on moving vehicles such as mobile robots, ships, aircraft, submarines, guided missiles, and spacecraft. What does an Inertial Navigation System (INS) offer over GPS alone? \u00b6 Dead Reckoning - An inertial navigation system (INS) integrates the IMU data to dead reckon (estimate position and velocity) between GPS updates and during GPS outage. Higher Data Rates - Typical GPS receivers data rates vary from 1Hz to 20Hz whereas INS systems like the IMX have data rates up to 1KHz. Signal Conditioning - An INS filters out noise in the GPS data and provides a smoother, more continuous data stream. Orientation Data - An INS is capable of observing the orientation (roll, pitch, and heading) of the system regardless of the motion or direction of travel. This is because of how an INS fuses inertial data with GPS data. A GPS with one antenna can measure direction of travel (ground track heading) but cannot estimate vehicle roll, pitch, or heading. Our Sensors - IMU vs AHRS vs INS \u00b6 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - Uses gyros and accelerometers to measure angular rate and linear acceleration. Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) - Adds sensor fusion to IMU and magnetometer output to estimate orientation or roll, pitch, and heading. Inertial Navigation System (INS) - Adds sensor fusion to IMU, GPS, magnetometer, and barometer data to estimate orientation, velocity, and position. I have my own GPS system and just need raw motion data, which sensor is for me? \u00b6 If you have your own filters in place and need raw data for measuring motion, then the IMU is the best option. The IMU provides raw, calibrated data for temperature, 3D acceleration (accelerometer), 3D magnetic field (magnetometer), and 3D rate of turn. Which sensor will also provide attitude (roll/pitch/yaw) and heading data? \u00b6 The AHRS sensor has all the capabilities of the IMU plus data on roll, pitch, and yaw. This sensor uses algorithms to fuse raw data from the IMU with the Earth\u2019s gravity to provide orientation and is perfect for a robotic arm or indoor floor cleaner. I need geographic positional data. Which sensor contains a GPS? If the AHRS doesn\u2019t get you what you need, packaging this with one or more GPS sensors will give you the geographic positional data you need. Like the AHRS, your sensor or should provide some sort of \u201csensor fusion\u201d by combining all the data from each of these sensors to give a more accurate and holistic view of your rover\u2019s state. What do I need to get started? We recommend beginning with some sort of Development Kit. Ours comes with all of the necessary components to simplify testing and integration: the sensor you selected, the needed cable and antennas for connectivity, the firmware & software, and 3-5 hrs of complementary engineering support from a team of Inertial Sense engineers. Additionally, Inertial Sense provides customers with a custom datalogger, called the EvalTool. An easy to use data logging software to test and troubleshoot your new sensor is essential to your sensor integration experience. How long can the IMX dead reckoning estimate position without GPS? \u00b6 The IMX inertial navigation integrates the IMU data to dead reckoning position and velocity estimation between GPS updates and for a short period of time during GPS outages. This dead reckoning is designed to filter out GPS noise and provide cleaner faster updates than are available via GPS alone. The IMX dead-reckons, or estimates position and velocity, between GPS updates and through brief GPS outages. However, it is not designed for extended position navigation without GPS aiding. Dead reckoning is disabled after 7 seconds of GPS outage in order to constrain position and velocity drift. The amount of position drift during dead reckoning can vary based on several factors, including system runtime, motion experienced, and bias stability. Can the IMX estimate position without GPS? \u00b6 IMX can estimate the position for extended periods of time without GPS for ground vehicle dead reckoning applications only (see Ground Vehicle Dead Reckoning ). When in standard mode (not ground vehicle dead reckoning) GPS is required to provide initial position estimation and to aid in IMU bias estimation. The IMX can dead reckon (estimate position without GPS) for brief periods of time. However, the quality of dead reckoning is a function of IMU bias estimation, which improves while the GPS is aiding the INS. How does the IMX estimate roll/pitch during airborne coordinate turns (acceleration only in the Z axis and not in the X and Y axes)? \u00b6 Using acceleration alone will incorrectly indicate the platform is level. GPS informs the IMX extended Kalman filter (EKF) about any motion the system experiences and as a result the EKF can distinguish between acceleration due to motion and gravity. Without a GPS (in AHRS mode) the IMX EKF can only assume the direction of gravity equals the average direction of acceleration measured slowly over time. The IMX can estimate roll/pitch under accelerated conditions during a coordinated turn because gyro integration prevents attitude drift over short term and level coordinate turns are cyclical allowing the average gravity for an entire heading rotation to be observed. However, the IMX AHRS solution under accelerated conditions (moving) will have degraded attitude accuracy. The IMX solution is more accurate when aided by GPS. How does vibration affect navigation accuracy? \u00b6 The IMX accuracy may degrade in the presence of mechanical vibrations that exceed 3g of acceleration. Empirical data shows degradation at approximately 100 - 150 Hz. Adding vibration isolation to the mount may be necessary to reduce the vibrations seen by the product and to improve accuracy. Can the IMX operate underwater? \u00b6 The IMX can only dead reckon for short periods of time and in general requires GPS to provide position and velocity data. The GPS antenna must be above the water surface in order for the GPS to function properly. It is ideal that the GPS antenna be fixed relative to the IMX (IMU) module in order to maintain precision when moving faster than 2 m/s or 0.8 m/s^2. However, the GPS antenna may be tethered above the IMX, where the GPS antenna is floating on the water surface and the IMX is below the water surface. System position will reflect the GPS antenna position and attitude (roll, pitch, heading) will reflect the IMX module orientation. Can the IMX operate at >4g acceleration? \u00b6 Typical L1 GPS receivers lose fix above 4g acceleration because the doppler variation starts to get too large and the receiver may become unstable or not be able to get/keep a fix. Additionally, the acceleration begins to affect the stability of the GPS XTAL oscillator. On the IMX, the GPS will regain fix within seconds after acceleration drops below 4g. The IMX will track the velocity and position using inertial navigation for up to 5 seconds of GPS outage. As long as GPS outage is below 5 seconds, the IMX should be able to track position through a launch. Customer Support \u00b6 Have other questions or needs?

The Inertial Sense CAN implementation is based on CAN2.0b specification and follows a specific structure and format which is outlined below. All of the CAN configuration is done using the data set DID_CAN_CONFIG. Enable CAN \u00b6 To enable the CAN bus interface on the IMX, set bit IO_CONFIG_G1G2_CAN_BUS in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.ioConfig . This bit can be set using the EvalTool >> Settings >> General >> DID_FLASH_CONFIG >> ioConfig >> Enable CAN Bus on G1,G2 option. A CAN message is enabled by entering a non-zero value in the DID_CAN_CONFIG. can_period_mult field of the desired message. The can_period_mult field is an integer which is multiplied by the Data Source Update Rate to determine the message broadcast period. Set can_period_mult to zero disable message broadcasting. In the image below the CID_INS_TIME message is set to broadcast data at 10 times the data source rate. The baud rate is configurable by setting the field DID_CAN_CONFIG.can_baudrate_kbps. The following standard baud rates are supported: 20 kbps 33 kbps 50 kbps 83 kbps 100 kbps 125 kbps 200 kbps 250 kbps 500 kbps 1000 kbps The message ID for each message can be entered into the can_transmit_address field corresponding to the desired message. *Note: Any message ID greater than 0x7FF will be transmitted in the extended ID format. The values set in any field of DID_CAN_CONFIG are saved to flash when a 'Save Persistent' command is received by the module. For example, this can be done in the EvalTool by clicking the Save Persistent button in the Data Logs tab. When the module is turned on, all the fields will be repopulated with the saved values.

Coning and Sculling integral) in body/IMU frame. Updated at IMU rate. Also know as delta theta delta velocity, or preintegrated IMU (PIMU). For clarification, the name \"Preintegrated IMU\" or \"PIMU\" throughout our User Manual. This data is integrated from the IMU data at the IMU update rate (startupImuDtMs, default 1ms). The PIMU integration period (dt) and INS NAV update data period are the same. DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupNavDtMs sets the NAV output period at startup. The minimum NAV update and output periods are found here: https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/imx/application-config/imu_ins_gnss_configuration/#navigation-update-and-output-periods . If a faster output data rate for IMU is desired, DID_IMU_RAW can be used instead. PIMU data acts as a form of compression, adding the benefit of higher integration rates for slower output data rates, preserving the IMU data without adding filter delay and addresses antialiasing. It is most effective for systems that have higher dynamics and lower communications data rates. The minimum data period is DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupImuDtMs or 4, whichever is larger (250Hz max).

For clarification, the name \"Preintegrated IMU\" or \"PIMU\" throughout our User Manual. This data is integrated from the IMU data at the IMU update rate (startupImuDtMs, default 1ms). The PIMU integration period (dt) and INS NAV update data period are the same. DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupNavDtMs sets the NAV output period at startup. The minimum NAV update and output periods are found here: https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/imx/application-config/imu_ins_gnss_configuration/#navigation-update-and-output-periods . If a faster output data rate for IMU is desired, DID_IMU_RAW can be used instead. PIMU data acts as a form of compression, adding the benefit of higher integration rates for slower output data rates, preserving the IMU data without adding filter delay and addresses antialiasing. It is most effective for systems that have higher dynamics and lower communications data rates. The minimum data period is DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupImuDtMs or 4, whichever is larger (250Hz max).

Protocol \u00b6 The SPI interface provides an alternative method of communications with the IMX-5. The SPI protocol uses much of the same structure and format as the serial communication binary protocol which is outlined in the Binary Protocol section of the users manual. Enable SPI \u00b6 To Enable SPI, hold pin G9 (nSPI_EN) low at startup. Note: When external GPS PPS timepulse signal is enabled on G9, the module will ignore the nSPI_EN signal and SPI mode will be disabled regardless of G9 pin state. Hardware \u00b6 Inertial Sense SPI interface uses 5 lines to interface with other devices. Line Function CS SPI Chip Select SCLK SPI Clock Synchronization Pin MISO SPI Master In Slave Out MOSI SPI Master Out Slave In DR SPI Data Ready Pin (optional) Hardware Configuration \u00b6 The IMX and GPX modules operate as a SPI slave device using SPI Mode 3 : SPI Settings SPI Mode 3 CPOL (Clock Polarity) 1 CPHA (Clock Phase) 1 Clock Polarity in Idle State Logic high Clock Phase Used to Sample and/or Shift Data Data sampled on the rising edge and shifted out on the falling edge. Chip Select Active low Data Ready Active high Data Transfer \u00b6 To ensure correct behavior of the receiver in SPI Slave mode, the master device sending the frame must ensure a minimum delay of one t bit (t bit being the nominal time required to transmit a bit) between each character transmission. Inertial Sense devices do not require a falling edge of the [Chip Select (CS)] to initiate a character reception but only a low level. However, this low level must be present on the [Chip Select (CS)] at least one t bit before the first serial clock cycle corresponding to the MSB bit. (1) When reading the IMX and there is no data ready it will send zeros for the data. Keeping CS low should not cause any issues. However, if the clocking between the master and slave processors gets out of sync there is nothing to get them back into sync. Ground bounce or noise during a transition could cause the IMX to see two clock edges when there should have only been one (due to an ESD or a fast transient event). Raising and lowering the CS line resets the shift register will resynchronize the clocks. Data Ready Pin Option \u00b6 There is a data ready pin option. This signal will be raised when data becomes ready.Also this line will go inactive a byte or two before the end of the packet gets sent. There is not a \"not in a data packet\" character to send. It is strictly done by data ready pin and parsing. Depending on when this happens there can be 1-4 bytes of zeros that will come out before the packet starts. If the chip select line is lowered during a data packet, the byte being transmitted (or that would be transmitted) can be lost. It is recommended to only lower the chip select when outside of a data packet and the data ready pin is inactive. The internal SPI buffer is 4096 bytes. If there is a buffer overflow, the buffer gets dropped. This is indicated by a data ready pin that is high without data being there. When an overflow happens, it clears the buffer, so the system could be in the middle of a packet and the IMX would just send zeros. If a request is sent to the IMX or the IMX sends a packet periodically it will resolve the situation. The SPI interface supports up to 3 Mbs data rate. (5 Mbs works if the data ready pin is used to receive the data - see B below.) Reading Data \u00b6 There are two strategies that can be used to read the data: A. Read a fixed data size out every set time interval. More data will be read than the uINx will produce on a regular interval, for instance, reading 512 bytes every 4 ms. Packet will be 0x00 padded if bytes read exceeds packet size. B. Read while the data ready pin is active or we are inside a data packet. One anomaly is the data ready pin will drop a byte or two before the end gets clocked out, hence needing to watch for the end of the packet. Pseudo Code for reading data: \u00b6 Check data ready pin. If pin is low, delay and check pin again. Lower CS line and read a block of data. Read sizes are arbitrary, but it tends to work better if the read count is long enough to contain most data packets. After read completes, check data ready pin. If it is high, read more data. DO NOT raise the CS line while the data ready pin is high, it will cause data loss. If data ready is low, raise CS line. On a busy system (and depending on baud rate) this would need to happen along with the data read as the data ready pin might not go low in between packets. Parse data looking for start of packet (0xFF) discarding data until found. Once found start saving the data. Save and parse data looking for end of packet (0xFE). Once found send packet off for use. If a start of packet character is seen while looking for the end, discard previous data and start the packet saving over. EVB-2 SPI Dev Kit \u00b6 The EVB-2 demonstrates SPI interface with the IMX. The EVB-2 ATSAM-E70 (E70) processor provides the example SPI interface with the IMX. The EVB-2 must be put into CBPreset mode 6 (CONFIG led color cyan) followed by a system reset to enable SPI mode. The EVB-2 (E70) project source code is available in the SDK for reference. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If every other character from a packet is lost it might be that the CS line is being toggled after every byte. The uINS-3.1 uses a USART SPI peripherial which requires a minimum delay of one t bit (t bit being the nominal time required to transmit a bit) spacing between characters sent. Reading bytes one by one may cause signifacnt time delays when streaming data. Depending on the ammount of data streaming, the uINS mable to keep up and the buffer could be overflow. Single message requests should work properly, but streaming probably will not work well. If the master hardware can't handle the delay, the uINS 3.2 hardware should be used.

It uses the native floating point and integer binary format used in computers. Binary protocol is not human readable like NMEA Protocol . Binary protocol uses Data Set (DID) C structures defined in SDK/src/data_sets.h of the InertialSense SDK. Endianness \u00b6 The IMX and GPX devices use little-endian byte order in the ISB protocol. Communication \u00b6 Writing to and reading from InertialSense products is done using \"Set\" and \"Get\" commands. The following helper function portWrite() which assists with writing data to the serial port is used throughout this document. static int portWrite ( int port , const unsigned char * buf , int len ) { return serialPortWrite ( & serialPort , buf , len ); } Setting Data \u00b6 The is_comm_set_data() function will encode a message used to set data or configurations. // Set INS output Euler rotation in radians to 90 degrees roll for mounting void setInsOutputRotation () { float rotation [ 3 ] = { 90.0f * C_DEG2RAD_F , 0.0f , 0.0f }; is_comm_set_data ( portWrite , 0 , comm , DID_FLASH_CONFIG , sizeof ( float ) * 3 , offsetof ( nvm_flash_cfg_t , insRotation ), rotation ); } Getting Data \u00b6 Data broadcasting or streaming is enabled by using the Realtime Message Controller ( RMC ) or the get data command. Get Data Command \u00b6 The is_comm_get_data() function will encode a PKT_TYPE_GET_DATA message that enables broadcast of a given message at a multiple of the Data Source Update Rates . Set the data rate (period multiple) to zero disable message broadcast and pull a single packet of data. Set the data size and offset to zero to request the entire data set. // Ask for INS message w/ update 40ms period (4ms source period x 10). Set data rate to zero to disable broadcast and pull a single packet. is_comm_get_data ( portWrite , 0 , comm , DID_INS_1 , 0 , 0 , 10 ); Data Source Update Rates \u00b6 DID Default Update Rate (Period) DID_INS_[1-4] (7ms default) Configured with DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupNavDtMs DID_IMU, DID_PIMU * (14ms default) Configured with DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupImuDtMs DID_BAROMETER ~20ms DID_MAGNETOMETER_[1-2] ~20ms DID_GPS[1-2]_[X] (Any DID beginning with DID_GPS) (200ms default) Configured with DID_FLASH_CONFIG. startupGPSDtMs All other DIDs 1ms *DID_PIMU integration period (dt) and output data rate are the same as DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupNavDtMs and cannot be output at any other rate. If a different output data rate is desired, DID_IMU which is derived from DID_PIMU can be used instead. Realtime Message Controller (RMC) \u00b6 The RMC is used to enable message broadcasting and provides updates from onboard data as soon as it becomes available with minimal latency. All RMC messages can be enabled using the Get Data Command , which is the preferred method, or by directly setting the RMC bits. The RMC bits are listed below. Message data rates are listed in the Data Source Update Rates table. RMC Message RMC_BITS_INS[1-4] RMC_BITS_DUAL_IMU, RMC_BITS_PIMU RMC_BITS_BAROMETER RMC_BITS_MAGNETOMETER[1-2] RMC_BITS_GPS[1-2]_NAV RMC_BITS_GPS_RTK_NAV, RMC_BITS_GPS_RTK_MISC RMC_BITS_STROBE_IN_TIME The following is an example of how to use the RMC. The rmc.options field controls whether RMC commands are applied to other serial ports. rmc.options = 0 will apply the command to the current serial port. rmc_t rmc ; // Enable broadcasts of DID_INS_1 and DID_GPS_NAV rmc . bits = RMC_BITS_INS1 | RMC_BITS_GPS1_POS ; // Remember configuration following reboot for automatic data streaming. rmc . options = RMC_OPTIONS_PERSISTENT ; is_comm_set_data ( portWrite , 0 , comm , DID_RMC , 0 , 0 , & rmc ); The update rate of the EKF is set by DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupNavDtMs (reboot is required to apply the change). Independently, the DID_INS_x broadcast period multiple can be used to set the output data rate down to 1ms. Persistent Messages \u00b6 The persistent messages option saves the current data stream configuration to flash memory for use following reboot, eliminating the need to re-enable messages following a reset or power cycle. To save persistent messages - (to flash memory), bitwise OR RMC_OPTIONS_PERSISTENT (0x200) with the RMC option field or set DID_CONFIG.system = 0x00000001 and DID_CONFIG.system = 0xFFFFFFFE. See the save persistent messages example in the Binary Communications example project. To disable persistent messages - a stop all broadcasts packet followed by a save persistent messages command. NMEA persistent messages are also available. Enabling Persistent Messages - EvalTool \u00b6 Enable the desired messages in the EvalTool \"Data Sets\" tab. Press the \"Save Persistent\" button in the EvalTool \"Data Logs\" tab to store the current message configuration to flash memory for use following reboot. Reset the system and verify the messages are automatically streaming. You can use the EvalTool->Data Logs dialog to view the streaming messages. To disable all persistent messages using the EvalTool , click the \"Stop Streaming\" button and then \"Save Persistent\" button. Enabling Persistent Messages - CLTool \u00b6 Persistent messages are enabled using the CLTool by including the -persistent option along with the options for the desired messages in the command line. cltool -c /dev/ttyS3 -persistent -msgINS2 -msgGPS Example Projects \u00b6 Examples on how to use the Inertial Sense SDK for binary communications are found in the Binary Communications Example Project and cltool project . NMEA communications examples are found in the NMEA Example Project . Parsing Data \u00b6 The ISComm library in the InertialSenseSDK provides a communications parser that can parse InertialSense binary protocol as well as other protocols. One Byte (Simple Method) \u00b6 The following parser code is simpler to implement. This method uses the is_comm_parse_byte() function to parse one byte at a time of a data stream. The return value is a non-zero protocol_type_t when valid data is found. uint8_t c ; protocol_type_t ptype ; // Read from serial buffer until empty while ( serialPortReadChar ( & s_serialPort , & c ) > 0 ) { // timeMs = current_timeMs(); switch ( is_comm_parse_byte ( & comm , inByte )) { case _PTYPE_INERTIAL_SENSE_DATA : break ; case _PTYPE_UBLOX : break ; case _PTYPE_RTCM3 : break ; case _PTYPE_NMEA : break ; } } Set of Bytes (Fast Method) \u00b6 The following parser code uses less processor time to parse data by copying multiple bytes at a time. This method uses is_comm_free() and is_comm_parse() along with a serial port read or buffer copy. The return value is a non-zero protocol_type_t when valid data is found. // Read a set of bytes (fast method) protocol_type_t ptype ; // Get available size of comm buffer. is_comm_free() modifies comm->rxBuf pointers, call it before using comm->rxBuf.tail. int n = is_comm_free ( comm ); // Read data directly into comm buffer if (( n = serialPortRead ( comm -> rxBuf . tail , n ))) { // Update comm buffer tail pointer comm -> rxBuf . tail += n ; // Search comm buffer for valid packets while (( ptype = is_comm_parse ( comm )) != _PTYPE_NONE ) { switch ( ptype ) { case _PTYPE_INERTIAL_SENSE_DATA : case _PTYPE_INERTIAL_SENSE_CMD : break ; case _PTYPE_UBLOX : break ; case _PTYPE_RTCM3 : break ; case _PTYPE_NMEA : break ; } } } ISB Packet Overview \u00b6 The IMX and GPX communicate using the Inertial Sense Binary (ISB) protocol. This section details the ISB protocol packet structure specific for protocol 2.x (software releases 2.x). Refer to the release 1.x ISB protocol document for a description of protocol 1.x (software releases 1.x). The Inertial-Sense-SDK ISComm provides functions to encode and decode ISB packets. ISB Packet \u00b6 The ISB packet structure is defined in the typedef packet_t found in ISComm.h . Header Type and Flags \u00b6 The packet type and flags are found in the byte at offset 2 in the ISB packet. The Type is the lower nibble and the Flags are the upper nibble. The packet and is defined in ISComm.h . typedef enum { PKT_TYPE_INVALID = 0 , // Invalid packet id PKT_TYPE_ACK = 1 , // (ACK) received valid packet PKT_TYPE_NACK = 2 , // (NACK) received invalid packet PKT_TYPE_GET_DATA = 3 , // Request for data to be broadcast, response is PKT_TYPE_DATA. See data structures for list of possible broadcast data. PKT_TYPE_DATA = 4 , // Data sent in response to PKT_TYPE_GET_DATA (no PKT_TYPE_ACK is sent) PKT_TYPE_SET_DATA = 5 , // Data sent, such as configuration options. PKT_TYPE_ACK is sent in response. PKT_TYPE_STOP_BROADCASTS_ALL_PORTS = 6 , // Stop all data broadcasts on all ports. Responds with an ACK PKT_TYPE_STOP_DID_BROADCAST = 7 , // Stop a specific broadcast PKT_TYPE_STOP_BROADCASTS_CURRENT_PORT = 8 , // Stop all data broadcasts on current port. Responds with an ACK PKT_TYPE_COUNT = 9 , // The number of packet identifiers, keep this at the end! PKT_TYPE_MAX_COUNT = 16 , // The maximum count of packet identifiers, 0x1F (PACKET_INFO_ID_MASK) PKT_TYPE_MASK = 0x0F , // ISB packet type bitmask ISB_FLAGS_MASK = 0xF0 , // ISB packet flags bitmask (4 bits upper nibble) ISB_FLAGS_EXTENDED_PAYLOAD = 0x10 , // Payload is larger than 2048 bytes and extends into next packet. ISB_FLAGS_PAYLOAD_W_OFFSET = 0x20 , // The first two bytes of the payload are the byte offset of the payload data into the data set. } eISBPacketFlags ; Header DID \u00b6 The data ID (DID) values are defined at the top of data_sets.h and identify which data set is requested or contained in the ISB packet. Header Payload Size \u00b6 In the ISB protocol, the packet payload size is a 16-bit unsigned integer (uint16) that specifies the payload\u2019s byte length, excluding the packet header and footer/checksum. If the ISB_FLAGS_PAYLOAD_W_OFFSET flag (0x20) is set in the header\u2019s flags byte, the optional 16-bit offset value is included in the payload length. Footer Checksum \u00b6 The ISB packet footer contains a Fletcher-16 (16-bit integer). The following algorithm is used for this checksum and is found in ISComm.h . uint16_t is_comm_fletcher16 ( uint16_t cksum_init , const void * data , uint32_t size ) { checksum16_u cksum ; cksum . ck = cksum_init ; for ( uint32_t i = 0 ; i < size ; i ++ ) { cksum . a += (( uint8_t * ) data )[ i ]; cksum . b += cksum . a ; } return cksum . ck ; } The ISB packet footer checksum is computed using the Fletcher-16 algorithm starting with an initial value of zero and sequencing over the entire packet (excluding the two footer checksum bytes). ISB Packet with Data Offset \u00b6 *The first two bytes of the payload may be a uint16 offset for the data offset in the target data set when the ISB_FLAGS_PAYLOAD_W_OFFSET flag is set in the header flags. ISB Packet with No Payload \u00b6 Packet types PKT_TYPE_STOP_BROADCASTS_ALL_PORTS , PKT_TYPE_STOP_DID_BROADCAST , PKT_TYPE_STOP_BROADCASTS_CURRENT_PORT have payload size zero and no payload. ISB Get Data Packet \u00b6 The Get Data packet of type PKT_TYPE_GET_DATA is used to query specific data according to data set ID, size, offset, and streaming period multiple. The payload size is 8. Setting the payload period to zero will result in a single response and a continuous stream of data for a non-zero period. Stop Broadcasts Packets \u00b6 Note The NEMA $STPB stop broadcasts command is recommended as the protocol version-independent method for disabling data streaming. Two stop all broadcasts packets are special packet types that will disable all binary and NMEA data streams. The following functions calls are provided in the SDK to generate the stop all broadcasts packets. All Ports \u00b6 is_comm_stop_broadcasts_all_ports ( portWrite , 0 , & comm ); The hexadecimal string to stop all broadcasts on all ports is: 0xef 0x49 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x3e 0x1f Current Port Only \u00b6 is_comm_stop_broadcasts_current_port ( portWrite , 0 , & comm ); The hexadecimal string to stop all broadcasts on the current port is: 0xef 0x49 0x08 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x40 0x27 RMC Presets \u00b6 RMC Preset Stream PPD \u00b6 The hexadecimal string for the RMC Preset enable PPD is: 0xef 0x49 0x05 0x09 0x0c 0x00 0xe2 0x3c 0x35 0x01 0x90 0x00 0x00 0xc0 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0xf7 0xb0","title":"Inertial Sense Binary (ISB)"},{"location":"user-manual/com-protocol/isb/#inertial-sense-binary-isb-protocol","text":"The Inertial Sense binary protocol provides the most efficient way to communicate with the IMX and GPX.

The NMEA protocol is human-readable in a command-line terminal, but it is less efficient than the binary protocol for the same data volume. Communications Example \u00b6 The NMEA Communications Example Project demonstrates how to implement the protocol. Packet Structure \u00b6 The Inertial Sense NMEA protocol follows the standard NMEA 0183 message structure: 1 byte \u2013 Start packet, $ ( 0x24 ) n bytes \u2013 packet identifier 1 byte \u2013 comma ( 0x2C ) n bytes \u2013 comma separated list of data, can include decimals and text 1 byte \u2013 checksum marker, * ( 0x2A ) 2 bytes \u2013 checksum in hex format (i.e. f5 or 0a ), zero-padded and lowercase 2 bytes \u2013 End packet, \\r\\n ( 0x0D , 0x0A ) The packet checksum is an 8-bit integer and is calculated by XORing all bytes between (but not including) the $ and * bytes. The packet checksum byte is converted to a 2-byte NMEA hex code, and left-padded with 0 if necessary to ensure that it is always 2 bytes. The checksum is always lowercase hexadecimal characters. See NMEA 0183 message structure for more details. The NMEA string checksum is automatically computed and appended to the string when using the Inertial Sense SDK serialPortWriteAscii function or can be generated using an online checksum calculator. For example: MTK NMEA checksum calculator Persistent Messages \u00b6 The persistent messages option saves the current data stream configuration to flash memory for use following reboot, eliminating the need to re-enable messages following a reset or power cycle. To save current NMEA persistent messages - send the $PERS command. To disable persistent messages - send STPB](#stpb) followed by [ STPB](#stpb) followed by [ PERS . Binary persistent messages are also available. Enabling Persistent Messages - EvalTool \u00b6 To enable persistent NMEA messages using the EvalTool: Enable the desired NMEA messages in the EvalTool \"Data Sets\" tab. Select DID_NMEA_BCAST_PERIOD in the DID menu and set the desired NMEA messages period to a non-zero value. Press the \"Save Persistent\" button in the EvalTool \"Data Logs\" tab to store the current message configuration to flash memory. Reset the IMX and verify the messages are automatically streaming. You can use a generic serial port program like putty or the EvalTool->Data Logs->Data Log->Messages dialog to view the NMEA messages. To disable all persistent messages using the EvalTool , click the \"Stop Streaming\" button and then \"Save Persistent\" button. NMEA Input Messages \u00b6 The following NMEA messages can be received by the IMX. Message Description $ASCE*14\\r\\n Query the broadcast rate of NMEA output messages. ASCE Set the broadcast period of selected NMEA output messages. $INFO*0E\\r\\n Query device information. $SRST*06\\r\\n Software reset. $PERS*14\\r\\n Save persistent messages to flash. $STPB*15\\r\\n Stop broadcast of all messages (NMEA and binary) on all ports. $STPC*14\\r\\n Stop broadcast of all messages (NMEA and binary) on current port. ASCE \u00b6 Enable NMEA message output streaming by specifying the NMEA message identifier or ID and broadcast period. The period is the multiple of the data source period (i.e., a GNSS message with period multiple of 2 and data source period of 200 ms (5 Hz) will broadcast every 400 ms). \"xx\" is the two-character checksum. The broadcast period for each message is configurable as a period multiple of the Data Source Update Rates . Up to 20 different NMEA messages can be enabled by repeating the message ID and period sequence within an ASCE message. Note: A period value of 0 requests a single (one-shot) message and disables streaming for that message. This provides a convenient way to query an NMEA message without enabling continuous streaming. $ASCE,OPTIONS,(ID,PERIOD)*xx\\r\\n Index Field Description 1 OPTIONS Port selection. Combine by adding options together: 0=current, 1=ser0, 2=ser1, 4=ser2, 8=USB, 512=persistent (remember after reset) Start of repeated group (1...20 times) 2+n*2 ID Either 1.) message identifier string (i.e., PPIMU, PINS1, GNGGA) excluding packet start character $ or 2.) message ID (eNmeaAsciiMsgId) of the NMEA message to be streamed.

This requires a high RHCP antenna gain, good view of the sky, and a short matched/tuned 50 \u03a9 input impedance line. This option may be appropriate to minimize BOM costs. Best performance is achieved by using an active antenna with integrated LNA. The LNA gain must be >17dB for standard GPS-INS use. For RTK and dual antenna (GPS compassing) use, the following characteristics are recommended: gain >26dB, multipath signal rejection, better signal to noise ratio, and improved carrier phase linearity.

For RTK and dual antenna applications we recommend dual feed (dual element) GNSS antennas GNSS Antenna Integration Considerations \u00b6 GNSS Antenna Ground Plane \u00b6 A GNSS antenna ground plane blocks multipath signals, creating a shadow area for the antenna to hide in. The ground plane is acting as an RF blocking device. It is made of any material that attenuates (or totally blocks or reflects) RF signals. It creates a shadow area for the antenna to hide in.

Firmware Update \u00b6 The following steps describe how to update the uBlox ZED-F9P firmware. The uBlox U-Center application software and firmware binary can be downloaded from the uBlox ZED-F9P documentation and resources webpage . Enable IMX Serial Bypass - Send the system command ( DID_SYS_CMD ) SYS_CMD_ENABLE_SERIAL_PORT_BRIDGE_USB_TO_GPS1 or SYS_CMD_ENABLE_SERIAL_PORT_BRIDGE_USB_TO_GPS2 to enable serial bypass on the IMX. This will create a direct connection between the current IMX serial port and the GPS. This is done in the EvalTool using the Factory Options dialog in the Settings -> General tab. Update Using U-Center - With the IMX serial bypass enabled, the uBlox U-Center software can connect directly to the ZED-F9P GPS. Use the following steps in the ublox U-Center app: Open the serial port with baudrate 921600. Select Tool -> Firmware Update and specify the uBlox F9P firmware file (i.e. UBX_F9_100_HPG132...bin ). Enable \"Use this baudrate for update\" as 921600. Disable \"Enter safeboot before update\". Enable \"Send training sequence\". Start the firmware update by pressing the small green \"GO\" circle in the bottom left corner of the Firmware Update Utility dialog. Power cycle the IMX.

NTRIP services do not require additional setup. An essential part of an RTK system is the Base Station which supplies correction messages from a known, surveyed location to the RTK Rover. The \u00b5INS Rover supports receiving RTCM3 and UBLOX correction messages. Surveying In Base Position \u00b6 Important \u200bAccuracy of the base position directly effects the rover absolute position accuracy. It is critical that the base position be surveyed in for rover absolute position accuracy. The base survey cannot happen at the same time as base correction output messages are enabled. If a survey is started the base correction output will automatically be disabled. The base position is stored in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.reflla and transmitted to the rover during RTK operation. The following steps outline how to survey in the base position. Mount base station in fixed location - The location should not change during or following a survey. Set survey-in parameters - This step can either be done using the EvalTool or programmatically using the data set ( DID_SURVEY_IN ). EvalTool \u00b6 Navigate to Settings > RTK > Base Mode. In the \"Survey In\" section select one of the States: Manual : Direct entry of base position.

EvalTool \u00b6 Open the COM port for the \u00b5INS under Settings > Serial Ports. Navigate to Settings > RTK > Base Mode. Under \"Correction Output\", find the fields for serial ports 0, 1, or USB. Select the serial port from which the corrections will be transmitted. This port must also be connected to the radio. Choose one of the options listed below. Leave the unused serial port off. \"GPS1 - RTCM3\": Output standard RTCM3 messages. \"GPS1 - uBlox\": Output uBlox messages. This will provide more accuracy but requires significantly more bandwidth. Change the \"Data Rate(ms)\" field. This determines how many milliseconds pass between message outputs (e.g. Data Rate(ms) = 1,000 means one message/second).

It replaces the need for magnetometers which can be problematic in the presence of ferrous materials (e.g. steel) and EMI generating circuits (e.g. electric motors and drivers). See the multi-band dual GNSS section for details on using our multi-frequency dual ZED-F9 GNSS system. Heading Accuracy \u00b6 The generalized heading accuracy for both the single-band (L1) and the dual GNSS multi-band systems under ideal conditions is shown in the following plot. Recommenced Minimum Baseline \u00b6 The recommended minimum baseline (distance between dual GNSS antennas) is 0.3 meters for single-band (L1) GNSS compassing and 0.25 meters for multi-band ZED-F9 GNSS compassing. The solution can operate at shorter baseline distances but is less robust and more susceptible to getting caught in a local minimum which may not converge to the correct heading. Antenna Orientation \u00b6 Important It is recommended that both GNSS antennas be identical and have the same physical orientation relative to each other (i.e. the antenna cable should exit in the same direction on both antennas). This will ensure best RF phase center alignment and heading accuracy. The actual RF phase center is often offset from the physical center of the antenna case. Mismatch Match Match Rugged GNSS Antenna Ports \u00b6 On the Rugged IMX, the MMCX port A is for GPS1 and MMXC port B is GPS2 . These port labels are changed to 1 and 2 on newer Rugged units. Dual Antenna Locations \u00b6 The location for both GPS antennae must be correctly specified by the user in the DID_FLASH_CONFIG variables within 1 cm accuracy: DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps1AntOffset[X,Y,Z] DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffset[X,Y,Z] These values describe the distance of each GPS antenna from the IMX Sensor Frame origin in the direction of the Sensor Frame axes. The Sensor Frame is defined using DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sensorConfig. Example Antennae Configurations \u00b6 The following are examples that illustrate what the GPS antenna offsets should be for two different antenna configurations. Drone \u00b6 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps1AntOffset[0] = 0.0 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffset[1] = -0.3 (negative direction of Y axis) DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffset[2] = 0.0 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffset[0] = 0.0 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffset[1] = 0.3 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffset[2] = 0.0 Automobile \u00b6 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps1AntOffsetX = -0.5 (negative direction of X axis) DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps1AntOffsetY = 0.5 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps1AntOffsetZ = -0.5 (negative direction of Z axis, above IMX) DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffsetX = -1.5 (negative direction of X axis) DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffsetY = 0.5 DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffsetZ = -0.5 (negative direction of Z axis, above IMX) GPS Antenna Ports \u00b6 The following table explains how ports A and B on the Rugged IMX map to GPS antennas 1 and 2. Ports Rugged IMX IMX Module and EVB-2 GPS 1 antenna port A 1 GPS 2 antenna port B 2 Setup \u00b6 Step 1 - Specify Offsets for Both Antennae \u00b6 Refer to the Dual Antenna Locations section for a description of the GPS antenna offset.

DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps2AntOffsetZ = ? Using EvalTool - select Data Sets -> DID_FLASH_CONFIG and set gps1AntOffset[X,Y,Z] and gps2AntOffset[X,Y,Z] with the GPS antenna offsets. Using CLTool - run the CLTool using the following options replacing the [OFFSET] with the GPS antenna offsets. -flashconfig=gps1AntOffsetX=[OFFSET] -flashconfig=gps1AntOffsetY=[OFFSET] -flashconfig=gps1AntOffsetZ=[OFFSET] -flashconfig=gps2AntOffsetX=[OFFSET] -flashconfig=gps2AntOffsetY=[OFFSET] -flashconfig=gps2AntOffsetZ=[OFFSET] Step 2 - Enable GPS Dual Antenna \u00b6 Set the RTK_CFG_BITS_COMPASSING (0x00000008) bit of RTKCfgBits. DID_FLASH_CONFIG . RTKCfgBits |= RTK_CFG_BITS_COMPASSING // |= 0x00000008 Using EvalTool - go to Settings -> RTK -> Rover Mode , set the dropdown menu to GPS Compassing , and press the Apply button. Using CLTool - run the CLTool using the -flashconfig=RTKCfgBits=0x8 option to enable GPS Dual Antenna. RTK Compassing Fix Status \u00b6 INS and GPS Status Flags \u00b6 The RTK compassing fix status can be identified using the valid bit in the INS and GPS status flags. DID_INS_1 . insStatus & INS_STATUS_RTK_COMPASSING_VALID // INS status - RTK heading is valid and aiding INS heading. DID_GPS1_POS . status & GPS_STATUS_FLAGS_GPS2_RTK_COMPASS_VALID // GPS status - RTK heading is valid and available in DID_GPS2_RTK_CMP_REL. RTK compassing fix is indicated when the RTK-Cmp radio button turns purple in the EvalTool INS tab. Progress and Accuracy \u00b6 The ambiguity resolution ratio, arRatio , is a metric that indicates progress of the solution that ranges from 0 to 999. Typically values above 3 indicate RTK fix progress. The base to rover heading accuracy indicates how much error is in the base to rover heading (RTK compassing heading). DID_GPS1_RTK_CMP_REL . arRatio // Ambiguity resolution ratio DID_GPS1_RTK_CMP_REL . baseToRoverHeadingAcc // (rad) RTK compassing accuracy The DID_GPS1_RTK_CMP_REL status can be monitored in the EvalTool GPS tab. Stationary Application \u00b6 For RTK compassing stationary application, enabling the STATIONARY INS dynamic model (DID_FLASH_CONFIG.dynamicModel = 2) is recommended to reduce heading noise and drift. This will reduce heading error during RTK compassing fix or loss of fix.

There are three major parts to the NTRIP system: The NTRIP client, the NTRIP server, and the NTRIP caster: The NTRIP server is a PC or on-board computer running NTRIP server software communicating directly with a GNSS reference station. The NTRIP caster is an HTTP server which receives streaming RTCM data from one or more NTRIP servers and in turn streams the RTCM data to one or more NTRIP clients via the internet. The NTRIP client receives streaming RTCM data from the NTRIP caster to apply as real-time corrections to a GNSS receiver. The EvalTool/CLTool software applications provide NTRIP client functionality to be used with the IMX RTK rover. Typically an EvalTool NTRIP client connects over the internet to an NTRIP service provider. The EvalTool/CLTool NTRIP client then provides the RTCM 3.3 corrections to the IMX and ZED-F9P rover connected over USB or serial. Virtual reference service (VRS) is also supported by the EvalTool/CLTool NTRIP client. Important If using a virtual reference service ( VRS ), the rover must output the NMEA GGA message to return to the NTRIP caster. Without this, the NTRIP caster will not provide correction information. NTRIP RTCM3 Messages \u00b6 The NTRIP server must provide the necessary subset of RTCM3 messages supported by the IMX-RTK.

Bit EVB2_PORT_OPTIONS_RADIO_RTK_FILTER of DID_EVB_FLASH_CFG.portOptions only allows RTK corrections to pass through the uinsAuxPort , reducing the wireless communications burden to only essential RTK base connections. This bit is enabled by default. EVB-2 Connections \u00b6 USB \u00b6 The most commonly used user interface available on the EVB-2 is the EVB USB port. Connecting to the EVB USB port will provide power to the device as well communications with the onboard SAME70 processor. After connecting to a PC the EVB2 will appear as a virtual COM port and can be configured to communicate with every other communication bus on the board. This USB port should be used when updating the EVB-2 firmware or bootloader. The EVB-2 also has a second USB port, IMX USB . This USB port also supplies power, but it connects directly to the \u00b5INS, \u00b5AHRS, or \u00b5IMU onboard the EVB-2. This USB port should be used when updating the \u00b5INS, \u00b5AHRS, or \u00b5IMU firmware or bootloader. GPS Antenna(s) \u00b6 If using GPS with the module, connect an appropriate antenna to GPS1 (J7) . If using the board for GPS compassing, connect a second antenna to GPS2 (J5) . More information on GPS antennas is available on the GNSS Antennas page. XBee Antenna \u00b6 If using the onboard XBee radio, ensure that the XBee radio U.FL connector (U10) is connected to the EVB-2 U.FL connector (J8). Connect an appropriate antenna to the EVB-2 RP-SMA connector (J5). To communicate with another XBee radio the PID and NID need to match on both radios. The PID and NID can be set using DID_EVB_FLASH_CFG.radioPID and DID_EVB_FLASH_CFG.radioNID . After setting the PID and NID, the EVB-2 needs to be reset so the radio can be configured. The XBee LED will flash Yellow then Green if the configuration is successful. A red LED signifies a failed radio configuration. Wi-Fi Antenna \u00b6 The XBee radio can be used along with the Wi-Fi module. In this case, a Wi-Fi antenna must be provided and connected to the U.FL port on the Wi-Fi module (U8). To use Wi-Fi alone, connect the U.FL connector on the Wi-Fi module (U8) to the EVB-2 U.FL connector (J8), and connect the Wi-Fi antenna to the XBee RP-SMA connector (J5). Header Pinouts \u00b6 Use JST-PH series connectors for EVB 2.x header H1. Maximum current is 2A per pin. Use JST-GH series connectors for all other EVB 2.x headers. Maximum current is 1A per pin.

Designator Manufacturer Part Number Description D1, D2 Littlefuse PESD0402-140 TVS DIODE 14VWM 40VC 0402 I1, I4 Murata LQW15ANR12J00D FIXED IND 120NH 110MA 2.66OHM SM Layout Guidance \u00b6 GNSS_RF Trace \u00b6 The GNSS_RF trace should be designed to work in the combined GNSS L1 + L5 signal band. For FR-4 PCB material with a dielectric permittivity of for example 4.2, the trace width for the 50 \u03a9 line impedance can be calculated. A grounded co-planar RF trace is recommended as it provides the maximum shielding from noise with adequate vias to the ground layer. The RF trace must be shielded by vias to ground along the entire length of the trace and the ZEDF9P RF_IN pad should be surrounded by vias as shown in the figure below. [INSERT LAYOUT FIGURE HERE] Design Guidance \u00b6 Backup Battery \u00b6 For achieving a minimal Time To First Fix (TTFF) after a power down (warm starts, hot starts), make sure to connect a backup battery to V_BCKP. Verify your battery backup supply can provide the battery backup current specified in the ZEDF9P datasheet. Allow all I/O including UART and other interfaces to float/high impedance in battery backup mode (battery back-up connected with VCC removed). RF Front-end Circuit Options \u00b6 Important Active antenna(s) are required for the GPX-1. Manufacturing \u00b6 Soldering \u00b6 The GPX-1 can be reflow soldered. Reflow information can be found in the Reflow Information page of this manual. Tape Packaging \u00b6 The GPX-5 modules are available in cut tape as well as tape and reel packaging. The follow image shows the feed direction and illustrates the orientation of the GPX-1 module on the tape: The feed direction to the pick and place pick-up is shown by the orientation of the GPX-1 pin 1 location. With pin 1 location on the bottom of the tape, the feed direction into the pick and place pick-up is from the reel (located to the right of the figure) towards the left.

Gently separate the top and bottom halves from each other pealing them apart opening from the side with the green connector. The two halves maybe somewhat adhered due to the thermal pad used in the device. Consistent gentle pressure will separate them. As the device starts to open, do not open the unit past 90 degrees. If flexed to often and beyond 90 degrees the ribbon will break causing the unit to be damaged beyond repair. Remove Kapton tape from the DIP Switch. (Save the tape!) Make your adjustment for the desired configuration. (see table above for switch configurations) Use of a small screwdriver or tweezers work well. It should not take much of force to move the desired switch. Replace the Kapton tape. Closed the two halves and install the 3 5/16\" screws back in the bottom. Done!

It is often desirable and conventional to translate the IMX output so that it is translated into the vehicle frame located at certain point for control and navigation of the vehicle. This is done using the Sensor Rotation , INS Rotation , and INS Offset parameters. In most common applications, output is translated to the vehicle frame (X to the front, Y to the right, and Z down): Sensor Rotation provides gross rotation of the IMU output in multiples of 90\u00b0. INS Rotation provides small angle alignment of the INS output. INS Offset shifts the location from the INS output. Coordinate Frame Relationship \u00b6 The relationship between the Hardware Frame, Sensor Frame, and INS Output Frame are as follows. The Hardware Frame and Sensor Frame are equivalent when the Sensor Rotation in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sensorConfig is zero. The Hardware Frame origin and Sensor Frame origin are always at the same location and may differ in direction according to the Sensor Rotation in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sensorConfig . The Sensor Frame and INS output Frame are equivalent when the DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insRotation and DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insOffset are zero. Sensor Rotation (Hardware Frame to Sensor Frame) \u00b6 The Sensor Rotation is used to rotate the IMU and magnetometer output from the hardware frame to the sensor frame by multiples of 90\u00b0 . This is done using the SENSOR_CFG_SENSOR_ROTATION_MASK bits of the DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sensorConfig as defined in enum eSensorConfig . The Sensor Rotation is defined in X,Y,Z rotations about the corresponding axes and applied in the order of Z,Y,X. This rotation is recommended for gross rotations. INS Rotation \u00b6 The INS rotation is used to convert the INS output from the sensor frame to the vehicle frame. This is useful if the sensor frame and vehicle frame are not aligned. The actual INS rotation parameters are DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insRotation[3] (X, Y, Z) in radians. The INS rotation values describes the rotation from the INS sensor frame to the intermediate frame in order of Z, Y, X. INS Offset \u00b6 The INS offset is used to shift the location of the INS output and is applied following the INS Rotation. This offset can be used to move the IMX location from the origin of the sensor frame to any arbitrary location, often a control navigation point on the vehicle. Manually Aligning the INS After Mounting \u00b6 NOTE for use: The Infield Calibration process can be used instead of this process to automatically measure and align the INS with the vehicle frame for INS rotations less than 15\u00b0. If using software release 1.8.4 or newer, we recommend using the DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sensorConfig to rotate the sensor frame by 90\u00b0 to near level before following the steps below. The following process uses the IMX to measure and correct for the IMX mounting angle. Set DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insRotation to zero. Set the sensor on the ground at various known orientations and record the INS quaternion output (DID_INS_2). Using the Euler output (DID_INS_1) can be used if the pitch is less than 15\u00b0. It is recommended to use the EKF Zero Motion Command to ensure the EKF bias estimation and attitude have stabilized quickly before measuring the INS attitude. Find the difference between the known orientations and the measured INS orientations and average these differences together. Negate this average difference and enter that into the DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insRotation . This value is in Euler, however it is OK for this step as this rotation should have just been converted from quaternion to Euler and will be converted back to quaternion on-board for the runtime rotation. Infield Calibration \u00b6 The Infield Calibration provides a method to 1.) zero IMU biases and 2.) zero INS attitude to align the INS output frame with the vehicle frame. These steps can be run together or independently. GNSS Antenna Offset \u00b6 If the setup includes a significant distance (40cm or more) between the GPS antenna and the IMX central unit, enter a non-zero value for the GPS lever arm, DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gps1AntOffset (or DID_FLASH_CONFIG.gpsAnt2Offset ) X,Y,Z offset in meters from Sensor Frame origin to GPS antenna. The Sensor Frame origin and Hardware Frame origin are always at the same location but may differ in direction according to the Sensor Rotation. IMU Sample and Navigation Periods \u00b6 The IMU sample period is configured by setting DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupImuDtMs in milliseconds. This parameter determines how frequently the IMU is measured and data integrated into the DID_PIMU data. DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupImuDtMs also automatically sets the bandwidth of the IMU anti-aliasing filter to less than one half the Nyquist frequency (i.e. < 250 / startupImuDtMs). The preintegrated IMU (PIMU) a.k.a. Coning and Sculling (delta theta, delta velocity) integrals serve as an anti-aliased moving average of the IMU value. The DID_IMU is the derivative of the DID_PIMU value over a single integration period. IMU Latency \u00b6 The IMU low-pass filter (LPF) adds latency (delay) to the signal in the IMU output. This latency can be expressed as: IMU Latency \\cong \\frac{2.197}{LPF bandwidth} IMU Latency \\cong \\frac{2.197}{LPF bandwidth} The default IMU sensor bandwidths (cutoff frequencies) and corresponding signal latencies are: Sensor Bandwidth Signal Latency Gyro 539 Hz 4.1 ms Accelerometer 416 Hz 5.3 ms Navigation Update and Output Periods \u00b6 The navigation filter output period should be set using the flash parameter DID_FLASH_CONFIG.startupNavDtMs . This value sets the DID_SYS_PARAMS.navOutputDtMs and DID_SYS_PARAMS.navUpdateDtMs during startup of the IMX. The navigation filter output period ( DID_SYS_PARAMS.navOutputDtMs ) determines the EKF output data rate, the maximum rate for messages DID_INS_1, DID_INS_2, and DID_INS_3. The navigation filter update period ( DID_SYS_PARAMS.navUpdateDtMs ) controls the EKF update rate and sets the standard integration period for the preintegrated IMU (PIMU) output. This parameter is automatically adjusted based on the value of DID_SYS_PARAMS.navOutputDtMs and the amount of CPU available. Minimum NAV Output and Update Period (Maximum Data Rate) \u00b6 The following table lists the output and update period minimum limits for the IMX. Operation Mode IMX-5 Minimum Output Period / Update Period IMX-6 Minimum Output Period / Update Period INS (GPS enabled) 7 ms (142 Hz) / 14 ms 2 ms (500 Hz) / 4 ms AHRS (GPS disabled) 5 ms (200 Hz) / 10 ms 2 ms (500 Hz) / 4 ms VRS (GPS and magnetometer disabled) 4 ms (250 Hz) / 8 ms 2 ms (500 Hz) / 4 ms INS-GNSS Dynamic Model \u00b6 The DID_FLASH_CONFIG.dynamicModel setting allows the user to adjust how the EKF behaves in different dynamic environments. All values except for 2 (STATIONARY) and 8 (AIR <4g) are experimental. The user is encouraged to attempt to use different settings to improve performance, however in most applications the default setting, 8: airborne <4g, will yield best performance. The STATIONARY configuration (dynamicModel = 2) can be used to configure the EKF for static applications. It is a permanent implementation of the Zero Motion Command which will reduce EKF drift under stationary conditions. Disable Magnetometer and Barometer Updates \u00b6 Magnetometer and barometer updates (fusion) into the INS and AHRS filter (Kalman filter) can be disabled by setting the following bits in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sysCfgBits . Bit Name Bit Value Description SYS_CFG_BITS_DISABLE_MAGNETOMETER_FUSION 0x00001000 Disable magnetometer fusion into EKF SYS_CFG_BITS_DISABLE_BAROMETER_FUSION 0x00002000 Disable barometer fusion into EKF These settings can be disabled using the General Settings tab of the EvalTool. Disable Zero Velocity Updates \u00b6 Zero velocity updates (ZUPT) rely on GPS and/or wheel encoder data. In some cases there can be a slight lag/deviation when starting motion while simultaneously rotating. This is because GPS data is updated at 5 Hz and it takes a few samples to detect motion after a period of no motion. When ZUPT is enabled, it acts as a virtual velocity sensor telling the system that its velocity is zero. It may conflict briefly with GPS velocity observation when starting motion. If a slight lag at the beginning of motion is an issue, ZUPT may be disabled. Generally it should be enabled (Default). It can be disabled using DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sysCfgBits or using the General Settings tab of the EvalTool. Disable Zero Angular Rate Updates \u00b6 Zero angular rate updates (ZARU) rely on analysis of either IMU (gyro) data or wheel encoders when available. When angular motion is very slow and no wheel encoders are available a zero angular rate may be mistakenly detected, which will lead to gyro bias estimation errors. In these cases it can be beneficial to disable ZARU if the applications has slow rotation rates (approximately below 3 deg/s). It is not encouraged to disable ZARU if there is no rotation or faster rotation. It can be disabled using DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sysCfgBits or using the General Settings tab of the EvalTool.","title":"IMU INS GNSS Config"},{"location":"user-manual/imx/application-config/imu_ins_gnss_configuration/#imu-ins-gnss-configuration","text":"","title":"IMU INS GNSS Configuration"},{"location":"user-manual/imx/application-config/imu_ins_gnss_configuration/#translation","text":"The IMX can be mounted and operated in any arbitrary orientation.

These steps can be run together or independently. Zeroing IMU Bias \u00b6 Zeroing IMU bias is a way to remove permanent offsets in the sensor output that may have occurred as a result of manufacturing or high shock. The system must be completely stationary for accurate bias measurement. The current value for IMU biases stored in flash memory is viewable in DID_INFIELD_CAL.imu when infield calibration is inactive and DID_INFIELD_CAL.sampleCount is zero. Accelerometer Bias \u00b6 In order to correct accelerometer bias on a given axis, that axis must be sampled while measuring full gravity. Thus, only the accelerometer axes that are sampled while in the vertical direction can be corrected. In order to correct all accelerometer axes, all three axes must be sampled while oriented vertically. The sample can be done while the axis is pointed up, down, or both up and down for averaging. Gyro Bias \u00b6 All three axes of the gyros are sampled simultaneously, and the bias is stored in flash memory. The system must be completely stationary for accurate bias measurement. The system does not need to be level to zero the gyro biases. Zeroing INS Attitude \u00b6 The Infield Calibration process can be used to align or level the INS output frame with the vehicle frame. This is done by observing the X,Y,Z axes rotations necessary to level the orientation(s) sampled. Zeroing the INS attitude as part of the Infield Calibration routine provides a optimal and highly accurate method for measuring the attitude while stationary by averaging raw bias corrected accelerations. Rotations cannot be computed for axes that are pointed vertically. For example, a single orientation sample with X and Y in the horizontal plane and Z pointed down will only be able to produce an X,Y rotation, and the Z rotation will remain zero. To compute all three rotations for the X,Y,Z axes, the system must be sampled at least twice, once while level and once while on its side. The infield calibration process is generally useful for only small angle INS rotations and is not intended for those larger than 15\u00b0 per axis. The user must set the INS rotation manually for larger rotations. The INS rotation is stored and accessed in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insRotation in flash memory. Because the sampled orientations are averaged together, it is recommended to only sample orientations that are at true 90\u00b0 multiples of the vehicle frame. The zero INS attitude feature assumes there are flat rigid surface(s) attached to the IMX about which the system can be leveled. If the working surface is not level or additional precision is desired, each orientation sampled can have an additional sample taken with ~180\u00b0 yaw offset to cancel out tilt of the working surface. If Infield Calibration is not adequate, the INS may be leveled or aligned manually . Infield Calibration Process \u00b6 The following process can be used to used to improve the IMU calibration accuracy and also align or level the INS to the vehicle frame. Prepare Leveling Surface - Ensure the system is stable and stationary on a near-level surface with one of three axes in the vertical direction. Initialize the Mode - Clear any prior samples and set the calibration mode by setting DID_INFIELD_CAL.state to one of the following: INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_IMU = 1 , // Zero accel and gyro biases. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_GYRO = 2 , // Zero only gyro biases. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_ACCEL = 3 , // Zero only accel biases. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_ATTITUDE = 4 , // Zero (level) INS attitude by adjusting INS rotation. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_ATTITUDE_IMU = 5 , // Zero gyro and accel biases. Zero (level) INS attitude by adjusting INS rotation. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_ATTITUDE_GYRO = 6 , // Zero only gyro biases. Zero (level) INS attitude by adjusting INS rotation. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_ATTITUDE_ACCEL = 7 , // Zero only accel biases. Zero (level) INS attitude by adjusting INS rotation. INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_OPTION_DISABLE_MOTION_DETECT = 0x00010000 , // Bitwise AND this with the above init commands to disable motion detection during sampling (allow for more tolerant sampling). INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_OPTION_DISABLE_REQUIRE_VERTIAL = 0x00020000 , // Bitwise AND this with the above init commands to disable vertical alignment requirement for accelerometer bias calibration (allow for more tolerant sampling). Zeroing accelerometer biases requires that any of the X,Y,Z axes be vertically aligned with gravity during sampling. This is indicated by bit INFIELD_CAL_STATUS_AXIS_NOT_VERTICAL = 0x01000000 in DID_INFIELD_CAL.status . By default, the system must also be stationary without any movement during sampling. This is indicated by bit INFIELD_CAL_STATUS_MOTION_DETECTED = 0x02000000 is set in DID_INFIELD_CAL.status . Motion detection can be disabled to make the system more tolerant during sampling. To do this, bitwise and INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_OPTION_DISABLE_MOTION_DETECT = 0x00010000 with the initialization command. As an example, the command to initialize INS alignment with zero IMU bias with motion detection disabled is as follows: ( INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_ZERO_ATTITUDE_IMU | INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_INIT_OPTION_DISABLE_MOTION_DETECT ); 0x00010101 = ( 0x00000101 | 0x00010000 ); Sample Orientation(s) - Initiate sampling of one or more orientations by setting DID_INFIELD_CAL.state to INFIELD_CAL_STATE_CMD_START_SAMPLE = 8 . Sampling per orientation will take 5 seconds and completion is indicated when DID_INFIELD_CAL.state switches to INFIELD_CAL_STATE_SAMPLING_WAITING_FOR_USER_INPUT = 50 . Sample Same Orientation w/ +180\u00b0 Yaw - If the working surface is not level, two samples per orientation can be taken to cancel out the tilt of the working surface.

This is done by observing the X,Y,Z axes rotations necessary to level the orientation(s) sampled. Zeroing the INS attitude as part of the Infield Calibration routine provides a optimal and highly accurate method for measuring the attitude while stationary by averaging raw bias corrected accelerations. Rotations cannot be computed for axes that are pointed vertically. For example, a single orientation sample with X and Y in the horizontal plane and Z pointed down will only be able to produce an X,Y rotation, and the Z rotation will remain zero. To compute all three rotations for the X,Y,Z axes, the system must be sampled at least twice, once while level and once while on its side. The infield calibration process is generally useful for only small angle INS rotations and is not intended for those larger than 15\u00b0 per axis. The user must set the INS rotation manually for larger rotations. The INS rotation is stored and accessed in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.insRotation in flash memory. Because the sampled orientations are averaged together, it is recommended to only sample orientations that are at true 90\u00b0 multiples of the vehicle frame. The zero INS attitude feature assumes there are flat rigid surface(s) attached to the IMX about which the system can be leveled. If the working surface is not level or additional precision is desired, each orientation sampled can have an additional sample taken with ~180\u00b0 yaw offset to cancel out tilt of the working surface.

Conversion from GPS time to UTC time requires knowledge of the number of leap seconds (GPS-UTC) offset. This value is received periodically (every 12.5 minutes) and is available in the DID_GPS1_POS and DID_GPS1_RTK_POS (gps_pos_t) messages. GPS leap seconds is 18 seconds as of December 31, 2016 and will change in the future . The original designers of GPS chose to express time and date as an integer week number (starting with the first full week in January 1980) and a time of week (often abbreviated to TOW) expressed in seconds. Working with time/date in this form is easier for digital systems than the more \"conventional\" year/month/day, hour/minute/second representation. Most GNSS receivers use this representation internally and converting to a more \"conventional form\" externally. GPS to UTC Time Conversion \u00b6 UTC time is found by subtracting GPS leap seconds from the GPS time. GPS Time Synchronization \u00b6 Systems connected to the IMX can be time synchronized using the GPS PPS timepulse signal and any message containing GPS time. The actual time of the GPS PPS timepulse signal is the same as any message with GPS time rounded down to the second. The following pseudo code illustrates how this is done. // GPS Time Synchronization - Find the difference between local time and GPS time: // 1. Sample your local time on the rising edge of the GPS PPS timepulse signal. double ppsLocalTime = localTime (); // 2. Read the GPS time from any message WITHIN ONE SECOND FOLLOWING the GPS PPS timepulse signal. double gpsTime = readGpsMessageTime (); // within one second after GPS PPS // 3.

Strobe I/O Events \u00b6 Strobe input and output (I/O) events are used for time and data synchronization. STROBE pins on the \u03bcIMU, \u03bcAHRS, and \u03bcINS Module - Top View Strobe Input (Time Sync Input) \u00b6 Strobe inputs are used to timestamp digital events observed on any of the pins labeled STROBE, e.g. camera shutter signals. A STROBE input event occurs when the logic level of any STROBE pin is toggled. The transition direction can be set so that the STROBE event triggers on a rising edge, or a falling edge. An internal 100K pull-up or pull-down resistor is enabled, depending on the assertion direction. External pull-up or pull-down resistors are not necessary. The STROBE input will trigger on the edge type specified. However, the minimum period between STROBE input pulses is 1 ms. The measurement and timestamp resolution are both 1 ms. The following pins can be used for STROBE input. Signal Module Pin EVB-1 Pin Rugged Pin EVB-2 G2 5 H2-4 12 H7-6 G5 9 H6-3 H7-9 G8 8 H6-6 H7-12 G9 10 Button \"B\" H7-13 To use a pin as a Strobe Input pin, the I/O must be configured as a strobe input. Additionally, the triggering edge must be set using the following bits in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.ioConfig . Bit Name Bit Value Description IO_CONFIG_STROBE_TRIGGER_LOW 0x00000000 Trigger strobe on falling edge IO_CONFIG_STROBE_TRIGGER_HIGH 0x00000001 Trigger strobe on rising edge Pushbutton \u201cB\u201d on the EVB asserts a logic low to G9 (pin 10) of the IMX and can be used to test the STROBE input functionality. **Note: Holding pin 9 low at startup enables SPI which uses pins 5 and 8 making them unavailable to be used as Strobe Inputs. If pin 9 is not held low, the internal pullup resistor holds it high at startup. This sets pins 5 and 8 as inputs which can be used as Strobe Inputs. A STROBE input event causes a timestamp message and INS2 message to be transmitted. The ASCII messages $PSTRB and $PINS2 messages are sent by default but can be disabled and replaced by the binary messages DID_STROBE_IN_TIME and DID_INS_2 if the RMC bit RMC_BITS_STROBE_IN_TIME is set for the given serial port. Example: rmc_t rmc; rmc.bits = RMC_BITS_STROBE_IN_TIME; int messageSize = is_comm_set_data_to_buf(buffer, bufferSize, comm, DID_RMC, sizeof(uint64_t), offsetof(rmc_t, bits), &rmc); if (messageSize != serialPortWrite(serialPort, comm->buffer, messageSize)) { printf(\"Failed to write save persistent message\\r\\n\"); } Table 2 - DID_STROBE_IN_TIME message transmitted following a SYNC input event. Field Type Description week uint32_t Weeks since January 6 th , 1980 timeOfWeekMs uint32_t Time of week (since Sunday morning) in milliseconds, GMT. pin uint32_t STROBE input pin count uint32_t STROBE serial index number The STROBE input event also causes the HDW_STATUS_STROBE_IN_EVENT (0x00000020) bit of the hdwStatus field in INS output (DID_INS_1, DID_INS_2, DID_INS_3, and DID_INS_4) to be set, allowing users to identify strobe input events using the INS output. Troubleshooting Input Strobe \u00b6 If the STOBE input does not appear to be functioning properly, an oscilloscope or fast multi-meter can be used to probe the actual STROBE line to ensure the proper 0V to 3.3V voltage swing is present. The following two tests can be used to evaluate the proper function of the strobe source and the IMX strobe input. TEST 1: Identify if the IMX strobe input is configured properly and has a low input impedance: Disconnect your strobe source from the IMX. Use a 1K ohm resistor as a pull-up resistor between 3.3V and the IMX strobe input and measure the strong input line. Repeat using the resistor as a pull-down resistor between ground and the strobe input and measure the strobe input line. This will tell if the IMX strobe input is somehow being driven internally or not configured correctly. If it is functioning correctly, the line will toggle from 0V to +3.3V following the resistor pull-down and pull-up. TEST 2: Identify if your strobe source is driving correctly: With the IMX strobe input disconnected from your strobe driving circuit, probe the output of the strobe driving circuit and observe what levels it toggles between. Attach a 1M ohm pull-down resistor from ground to the strobe output and observe the strobe voltage swing. If the circuit is working correctly, it should drive the strobe output from 0V to +3.3V despite the 1M ohm pull-down resistor. Input Voltage Level Shifter \u00b6 The maximum input voltage for strobe lines (any pin on the IMX) is 3.6V. A level shifter may be used to convert any strobe signal that is larger than 3.3V. The following figure shows two passive level shifter circuits, a zener diode voltage clamp and a resistor voltage divider. These circuits are beneficial because of their simplicity. An active, powered level shifter may also be used and necessary. Strobe Output (Preintegrated IMU Period) \u00b6 The STROBE output feature generates a 1\u202fms pulse on pin G9, with the leading edge marking the start of the preintegrated IMU (PIMU) integration period. To enable this output, set the IO_CONFIG_G9_STROBE_OUTPUT_NAV bit (0x00000020) in DID_FLASH_CONFIG.ioConfig . The polarity of the pulse is configured by setting the IO_CONFIG_STROBE_TRIGGER_HIGH bit (0x00000001) in the same field. Configuring Message Output \u00b6 By default, triggering a strobe input event will cause the IMX to produce an NMEA PINS2 message as well as a PSTRB message which contains the time stamp of the strobe event. To instead send a binary DID_INS_2 and DID_STROBE_IN_TIME message, set the RMC_BITS_STROBE_IN_TIME flag of DID_RMC/bits field.","title":"Time Sync/Strobe"},{"location":"user-manual/imx/application-config/time_sync/#time-synchronization","text":"","title":"Time Synchronization"},{"location":"user-manual/imx/application-config/time_sync/#ins-gps-timestamps","text":"The IMX output messages are timestamped using GPS time-base because this time is known immediately following GPS signal reception.

TEST 1: Identify if the IMX strobe input is configured properly and has a low input impedance: Disconnect your strobe source from the IMX. Use a 1K ohm resistor as a pull-up resistor between 3.3V and the IMX strobe input and measure the strong input line. Repeat using the resistor as a pull-down resistor between ground and the strobe input and measure the strobe input line.

Because impulse shocks can saturate sensors and exceed their effective bandwidth---producing invalid data that would otherwise corrupt Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) estimates---the system employs specialized algorithms to detect, isolate, and reject shock-induced disturbances. When a shock is detected, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is rewound to remove corrupted measurements and maintain navigation solution integrity. Without Shock Rejection \u00b6 In the absence of a shock rejection mechanism on platforms such as the IMX-5, the attitude solution (comprising roll, pitch, and heading) can exhibit significant degradation, manifesting as attitude offset deviations of up to +10 degrees from the true value. This degradation underscores the critical need for a robust mitigation strategy. Performance With Shock Rejection \u00b6 Shock Rejection Enabled \u00b6 When the shock rejection feature is active, a substantial impulse can be observed on the IMU accelerometer's X-axis. The true peak magnitude of this shock is often unidentifiable due to the large impulse force exceeding the sensor's bandwidth limitations. During the event, the IMU status flags provide crucial diagnostic information, recording both sensor saturation and successful shock detection. Critically, because the shock event is accurately identified and mitigated, the attitude estimate (roll, pitch, and yaw) remains largely impervious to the shock input, preserving the accuracy and reliability of the navigation solution. Because the shock is properly identified, the attitude estimate (roll, pitch, yaw) is relatively unaffected by the shock input. How to Enable Shock Rejection \u00b6 The shock rejection feature is configured through specific bit settings within the Software Development Kit (SDK) and must be applied to the DID_FLASH_CONFIG.imuShockOptions register: IMU_SHOCK_OPTIONS_ENABLE (0x01): Activates the IMU shock rejection functionality. IMU_SHOCK_OPTIONS_FAST_RECOVERY (0x02): This option is particularly beneficial when impulse shocks occur concurrent with platform rotation. It minimizes the post-shock integration error and substantially reduces the time required for attitude convergence. However, it is important to note that this setting can marginally increase the attitude error induced directly by the shock event itself. Therefore, its use is generally discouraged for applications where the platform is stationary and not undergoing rotation during shock occurrences. Configuration \u00b6 The shock rejection can be tuned if needed using the following parameters.

INS_STATUS_HDG_ALIGN_COARSE and INS_STATUS_HDG_ALIGN_FINE flags indicate whether INS heading is aided by any heading sensor (including GPS or magnetometer). More accurate heading sensors (i.e. GPS) are prioritized over less accurate sensors (i.e. magnetometers) and will fall back to the less accurate sensors when the more accurate sensors are not available.

Therefore, the receiver must search the full time and frequency space, and all possible satellite numbers. If a satellite signal is found, it is tracked to decode the ephemeris (18-36 seconds under strong signal conditions), whereas the other channels continue to search satellites. Once there are enough satellites with valid ephemeris, the receiver can calculate position and velocity data. Other GNSS receiver manufacturers call this startup mode Factory Startup. Warm start - In warm start mode, the receiver has approximate information for time, position, and coarse satellite position data (Almanac). In this mode, after power-up, the receiver normally needs to download ephemeris before it can calculate position and velocity data. As the ephemeris data usually is outdated after 4 hours, the receiver will typically start with a Warm start if it has been powered down for more than 4 hours. Hot start - In hot start mode, the receiver was powered down only for a short time (4 hours or less), so that its ephemeris is still valid. Since the receiver doesn't need to download ephemeris again, this is the fastest startup method. Battery backed-up power supplied to the IMX preserves the GPS time, position, and coarse satellite position (almanac) while off. GPS almanac data is typically valid for several weeks while the GPS is off. Preintegrated IMU \u00b6 Also known as Coning and Sculling Integrals, \u0394 Theta \u0394 Velocity, or Integrated IMU. For clarification, we will use the name \"Preintegrated IMU\" or \"PIMU\" throughout the User Manual. They are integrated by the IMU at IMU update rates (1KHz). These integrals are reset each time they are output. Preintegrated IMU data acts as a form of compression, adding the benefit of higher integration rates for slower output data rates, preserving the IMU data without adding filter delay. It is most effective for systems that have higher dynamics and lower communications data rates. The IMX-5 uses Bortz for angular rates (which yield rotation from the previous pose) and full dual gyro and accelerometer integration for change in body velocities from the previous pose. The PIMU is NOT integrated from each axis separately. IMU Bias Repeatability (Turn-on to Turn-on Bias) \u00b6 The initial bias will be different for each power up of the IMU due to signal processing initial conditions and physical properties. A more repeatable bias allows for better tuning of INS parameters and faster estimate of the bias, whereas a more variable initial turn-on bias causes more difficult and longer INS convergence startup time. IMU Bias Stability (In-Run Bias) \u00b6 Describes the amount of bias change during any one run-time following poweron. This change is caused by temperature, time, and mechanical stress. The INS navigation filter estimates the IMU biases in order to improve the state estimate. The IMU bias stability directly impacts the accuracy of the INS output. Random Walk \u00b6 The IMU sensors measure a signal as well as noise or error, described as a stochastic process. During IMU integration in the INS, sensor noise is accumulated and produces a random walk or drift on the final solution. Random walk has a direct effect on the accuracy of the INS output. Sensor Orthogonality (Cross-Axis Alignment Error) \u00b6 The three axis gyro and accelerometer sensors found in an IMU have measurement axes at 90 degrees from each other, maximizing the observability of the system. In practice, these sensing axes in a three axis sensor are not perfectly at 90 degrees of each other, or misaligned slightly due to manufacturing imperfection.

These values represent the rate at which random walk (drift) accumulates over time. To model this noise accurately in simulations, we need to translate the datasheet specifications into standard deviations that correspond to the chosen sampling rate (100 Hz, or 0.01 seconds per sample). This involves converting the ARW and VRW values from per \\sqrt{\\text{hour}} \\sqrt{\\text{hour}} to per \\sqrt{\\text{second}} \\sqrt{\\text{second}} and then adjusting them based on the sampling interval, yielding noise characteristics that realistically represent the IMU's behavior in a simulated environment.

Sources for interference include: EMI at the GPS antenna. EMI at the IMX module. EMI conducted through the power supply or I/O lines. Common sources for noise and interference are digital lines, USB 3.x, noisy power supplies, etc. Detecting Interference \u00b6 To detect if interference is being coupled into the Inertial Sense sensor module, it can be compared with a stock EVB demo unit to compare noise figures. This is done by using the following steps. If both steps pass, there is no noise being coupled into the module. Optionally connect multiple sensor modules can be connected to the EvalTool in parallel to compare noise. Evaluate the IMU sensor - Make sure the unit is stationary (on a table or non-moving surface) and not seeing any vibrations. Watch the standard deviation columns labeled \"\u03c3\" in the Sensors tab of the EvalTool. This shows the noise level over the past 5 seconds, which means the device needs to be completely stable for 5 seconds to be accurate. Compare this figure between the integrated sensor module and EVB demo unit. Evaluate GPS sensitivity \u2013 In clear view of the sky, monitor the satellite signal strength through the DID_GPS_NAV.cnoMax and DID_GPS_NAV.cnoMean fields in the EvalTool \"Data Sets\" tab or in the EvalTool \"GPS\" tab. See that the strongest (largest) CNO values are roughly the same between the integrated sensor module and the EVB demo unit. Interference Mitigation \u00b6 The best solution is to stop the EMI (emitted) or conducted noise at its source. If it is not possible to completely eliminate the source, the following methods should be considered depending on the cause of interference: GPS antenna location - Position the GPS antenna at the top of the vehicle, clear of obstructions and away from noise sources such as motors, processors, USB cables, digital devices, etc. USB 3.x typically generates quite a bit of EMI and interferes with the GPS. Added shielding and/or signal inline USB filters can be added USB 3.x to reduce EMI and mitigate GPS interference. Symptoms of GPS interference are poor GPS CNO signal strength, long times to lock, slip out of lock, etc. GPS antenna ground plane - Adding a 2\"-3\" diameter metallic ground plane below the GPS antenna will improve CNO noise ratio and improve sensitivity. This can help in noisy environments. You can use any scrap metal or PCB to test the concept by simply placing it below the GPS antenna (no electrical grounding required). The ground plane can have holes to reduce the weight and aerodynamic effects. Shielding around the Inertial Sense module - This can further prevent EMI from being absorbed by potentially GPS sensitive circuitry on the module. Digital signals - Making sure best practices for electrical current return paths for both common mode and differential mode signals can be key for this. Customers have seen GPS interference caused by USB 3.x and have have resolved the issues using shielding and inline USB filters . Power supply filtering - This may be necessary on systems with significant digital noise. LC filters or similar filters can be added inline between the power supply and the IMX supply input (Vcc). Common switching mode/buck voltage regulators should be fine for use with the IMX module and not require additional filtering. Please contact us at support@inertialsense.com if further support is needed. Magnetic Interference \u00b6 Magnetic interference may impact IMX magnetometer performance if surrounded by steel or ferrous material or near motors, motor drivers, or other electronics that cause EMI. This interference can be observed in the magnetometer output, magnetometer status, and INS heading. Make sure all components are fixed in location during this test. While powering and actuating the various interference sources, observe the following: Magnetometer Output should remain constant and not deviate. (EvalTool Sensors tab) Magnetometer Status should remain good and not indicate interference. (EvalTool INS tab, \"Mag used\" green = good, yellow = interference) INS Heading (yaw) estimate should not drift or change direction. (EvalTool INS tab, \"Yaw\") If any of these items are affected during the test, the system may result in incorrect magnetometer and heading values. Mechanical Vibration \u00b6 The system accuracy may degrade in the presence of mechanical vibrations that exceed 3 g of acceleration. Empirical data shows degradation at approximately 100 - 150 Hz. Adding vibration isolation to the mount may be necessary to reduce the vibrations seen by the product and to improve accuracy. Temperature Sensitivity \u00b6 The system is designed to compensate for the effects of temperature drift, which can be found in typical operation. However, rapid hardware temperature changes can result in degraded accuracy of the IMU calibration, GPS position, and INS estimate. Rapid temperature change can be caused by direct exposure to wind, sun, and other elements.","title":"Interference"},{"location":"user-manual/reference/interference/#interference-considerations","text":"Electrical interference or noise can be coupled into the Inertial Sense module in the form of electromagnetic interference (EMI) through the air or electrically conducted through wiring.

While powering and actuating the various interference sources, observe the following: Magnetometer Output should remain constant and not deviate. (EvalTool Sensors tab) Magnetometer Status should remain good and not indicate interference. (EvalTool INS tab, \"Mag used\" green = good, yellow = interference) INS Heading (yaw) estimate should not drift or change direction.

The system allows for two types of modes for recalibration, external initiated and automatically initiated re-calibration. Regardless of the recalibration mode, a slower online background calibration runs that continuously improves the magnetometer calibration to handle local magnetic environment changes. All magnetometer calibration is stored in flash memory and available on bootup. Disable Magnetometer Updates \u00b6 Magnetometer fusion into the INS and AHRS filter can be disabled by setting bit SYS_CFG_BITS_DISABLE_MAGNETOMETER_FUSION (0x00001000) of DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sysCfgBits . Magnetometer Recalibration \u00b6 Occasionally the magnetometer will require a complete recalibration, replacing the old calibration with an entirely new calibration. This is accomplished either through external or automatic initiated recalibration. Use of the different modes is generally governed by the particular use case for the end customer and is intended to allow for the most flexibility in an integrated product design. External Recalibration \u00b6 External magnetometer recalibration allows the most flexibility in determining when an end user will need to recalibrate the system. This control over the timing of the recalibration is critical for many use cases and allows product designers to implement their desired workflows for customers. Further there are use cases where automatic recalibration is not possible because the quality of the magnetometer calibration is not observable. Such use cases would include AHRS operation, extended periods without motion or no GNSS fix. External magnetometer recalibration, as the name suggests is triggered by an external command from the application managing the IMX hardware. The IMX provides a set of status messages indicating the quality of the magnetometer calibration and leaves the timing and implementation of a recalibration up to the product designer. Specifically, INS_STATUS_MAG_INTERFERENCE_OR_BAD_CAL is an indication of the quality of the magnetometer calibration (see system status flags for details). During the calibration process, the system should be clear of steel, iron, magnets, or other ferrous materials (i.e. steel desks, tables, building structures). The IMX should be attached to the system in which it is operating and rotated together during the calibration process. The following is the Force magnetometer recalibration procedure: Set DID_MAG_CAL.recalCmd to either: * MAG_CAL_STATE_MULTI_AXIS (0) for Multi-Axis which is more accurate and requires 360\u2070 rotation about two different axes. * MAG_CAL_STATE_SINGLE_AXIS (1) for Single-Axis which is less accurate and requires 360\u2070 rotation about one axis. Rotate the system accordingly. Recalibration completion is indicated by either: INS_STATUS_MAG_RECALIBRATING bit of the insStatus word set to zero. The insStatus word is found in standard INS output messages ( DID_INS_1 , DID_INS_2 , DID_INS_3 , and DID_INS_4 ). DID_MAG_CAL.progress is 100. Recalibration progress is indicated as a percentage (0-100%) is indicated can be observed from variable DID_MAG_CAL.progress . The recalibration process can be canceled and the prior calibration restored anytime by setting DID_MAG_CAL.enMagRecal = MAG_RECAL_MODE_ABORT (101). The \u201cMag used\u201d indicator in the EvalTool INS tab will be green when magnetometer data is being fused into the solution, black when not being fused into the solution, and red during recalibrating. Example code: #include \"com_manager.h\" // Set DID_MAG_CAL.enMagRecal = 0 for multi-axis recalibration int32_t value = MAG_RECAL_MODE_MULTI_AXIS ; sendDataComManager ( 0 , DID_MAG_CAL , & value , 4 , offsetof ( mag_cal_t , enMagRecal )); // Enable broadcast of DID_MAG_CAL.progress every 100ms to observe the percent complete sendDataComManager ( 0 , DID_MAG_CAL , 0 , sizeof ( mag_cal_t ), 100 ); Automatic Recalibration \u00b6 Automatic magnetometer recalibration is useful for systems where user intervention to start external calibration is not convenient or practical. In this mode, the solution will determine that the system needs to be recalibrated and will attempt to do so while in normal operation. In the period while the system is recalibrating, the uncalibrated magnetometer data is used to prevent the INS heading from drifting but it does not provide heading measurements to the state estimator. This feature is enabled by setting bit SYS_CFG_BITS_AUTO_MAG_RECAL (0x00000004) of DID_FLASH_CONFIG.sysCfgBits non-volatile word. // Enable automatic magnetometer calibration. DID_FLASH_CONFIG . sysCfgBits |= SYS_CFG_BITS_AUTO_MAG_RECAL ; // Disable automatic magnetometer calibration. DID_FLASH_CONFIG . sysCfgBits &= ~ SYS_CFG_BITS_AUTO_MAG_RECAL ; Magnetometer Continuous Calibration \u00b6 To mitigate the need for recalibration (completely replace calibration data), continuous calibration improves the magnetometer calibration slowly over time. Continuous calibration always runs in the background. Magnetometer Calibration Settings \u00b6 The magnetometer calibration algorithm can produce higher quality calibrations when data more data is collected across multiple axes of rotation. However, there are use cases where data collection beyond a single axis is impractical if not impossible. To address this issue there is a setting in the flash to configure the data requirement threshold for magnetometer calibration. The available settings include: Single Axis Calibration \u2013 This setting requires a full rotation in the yaw axis (relative to earth) to determine the calibration. Additional data that is collected via motion on other axes is used but not required. Once a full rotation is completed the calibration is calculated and the online continuous calibration is started. Multi Axis Calibration \u2013 This setting requires data to be collected across at least two axes, where one is the yaw axis. This calibration mode does not have any specific angular rotational requirements in any given axes, but it does require that data has been collected across a sufficient angular span. There is an indicator ( mag_cal_threshold_complete ) in the DID_SYS_PARAMS message that relates the total percent of the required threshold that has been collected. As more data is collected this value will increment to 100% at which point the calibration will be calculated and the online continuous calibration will continue to run /*!

This include the ability to update an IMX-GPX module pair in one step. The cltool only needs know the file path of the firmware package file and the serial port of the device to be updated. The file extension for a firmware package is .fpkg . NOTE: Updating the IMX firmware using a firmware package currently not supported and will become available in a future update. cltool -c DEVICE_PORT -ufpkg FILEPATH The following is a specific example of using a firmware package file: cltool -c /dev/ttyACM0 -ufpkg IS-firmware_2.0.3_2024-03-18_213925.fpkg Updating using Single Firmware File (Legacy Mode) \u00b6 The CLTool can be used to update device firmware with the following options. This is the legacy firmware update methods that works only with the IMX-5 and earlier products (uINS-3, EVB-2, etc.). cltool -c DEVICE_PORT -uf [ FW_FILEPATH ] -ub [ BL_FILEPATH ] -uv Options Description -c DEVICE_PORT Specifies the device serial or USB port (i.e. /dev/ttyACM0 ). -uf [FW_FILEPATH] Specifies the application firmware file path. -ub [BL_FILEPATH] (Optional) Specified the bootloader firmware file. The bootloader is only updated if the version of the file provided is newer than the bootloader version currently on the device. -uv (Optional) Run verification after application firmware update. The following is a specific example: cltool -c /dev/ttyS2 -uf fw/IS_IMX-5.hex -ub fw/IS_bootloader-STM32L4.hex -uv Note: The firmware can only be updated at the following baud rates: 300000, 921600, 460800, 230400, 115200 Logging with CLTool \u00b6 The CLTool can be used to log data to file with the following options: cltool -c DEVICE_PORT -lon -lt = LOG_TYPE -lp DIRECTORY Options Description -lon Enable logging. -lt=LOG_TYPE Specifies the log file type to be written. LOG_TYPE can be raw , dat , or csv . -lp DIRECTORY (Optional) Specifies the path where log files will be written. When not specified, the default location will be the current working directory. Log File Types \u00b6 Log Type \u00b6 Log Type Description raw Binary file containing byte for byte data received over the serial ports. All packets remain in their native form. Used for logging InertialSense binary (ISB), NMEA, RTCM3, uBlox UBX binary and SPARTN, and any other packet formats. Recommended for logging all data formats and post processing . dat Binary file containing InertialSense binary (ISB) DID data sets in \"chunk\" groups containing data in serial order as they appear over the serial port. Default file format. Recommended for post processing. csv Comma-Separated Values - Plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. Its basic format involves separating each data field (or cell in a table) with a comma and each record (or row) is on a new line. This simple format allows for ease in data import and export between programs that handle tabular data, such as databases and spreadsheets. The following is an example of enabling the logger with type raw and specifying the output directory: ./cltool -c /dev/ttyACM0 -lon -lt = raw -lp /media/usbdrive/data Command Line Options \u00b6 Navigate to the directory /cpp/SDK/cltool/build and run the CLTool with the help option, \" -h \" ./cltool -h to display the command line options Command Line Options in MS Visual Studio \u00b6 When using MS Visual Studio IDE, command line arguments can be supplied by right clicking the project in the solution explorer and then selecting Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Command Arguments (see image below).","title":"CLTool"},{"location":"user-manual/software/cltool/#cltool","text":"","title":"CLTool"},{"location":"user-manual/software/cltool/#overview","text":"The Inertial Sense CLTool is a command line utility that can be used to read and display data, update firmware, and log data from Inertial Sense products.

The example code can be found in the Inertial Sense SDK Arduino project . Important Update the IMX to the latest firmware This example demonstrates how to use the Inertial Sense EVB with an Arduino Due. The Due was selected because it has two serial ports. This way the Arduino can communicate with the IMX using one of the ports, and write the output over the Serial Monitor to the computer using the other. Warning The InertialSense SDK requires 64-bit double support. 32-bit processors (Arduino Due, Zero, and M0) are supported. 8-bit processors (i.e. Arduino Mega and Uno) are NOT supported. The ASCII protocol (not covered in this example) may be used on an 8-bit Arduino. Note A Raspberry PI (similar in price to the Arduino) is a good alternative to the Arduino. Either the Binary Communications and ASCII Communications example projects can be run on a Raspberry PI. Wiring Guide \u00b6 After downloading the Inertial Sense SDK , navigate to ExampleProjects/Arduino/ReadIS. Use the ImportSdkFiles.bat (Windows) or ImportSdkFiles.sh (Linux) to copy the required files from the SDK into src/ISsdk directory. The resulting file structure for the ReadIS Arduino sketch should look like the following: |-ReadIS | - ImportSdkFiles.bat | - ImportSdkFiles.sh | - ReadIS.ino | - src | - ISsdk | - data_sets.c | - data_sets.h | - ISComm.c | - ISComm.h | - ISConstants.h What is an ino file? An .ino file is the arduino extension for a sketch. It is actually C++ code. Note Note that there are two .c files in the tree. You'll need to make sure that these files are compiled by the toolchain, otherwise xxxx is not defined errors can occur. SDK Implementation \u00b6 ReadIS.ino file explained: Step 1: Add Includes \u00b6 The \"ISComm.h\" header file includes all the other required code. stddef.h file from the standard library is required for the offsetof function. #include \"src/ISsdk/ISComm.h\" #include <stddef.h> Step 2: Create buffers \u00b6 Next, define a buffer to hold data. As the IMX sends data, this buffer is used to hold the data until a full message arrives. This buffer only needs to be as big as the largest message expected, multiplied by two + 32 (worst case scenario if there is a bad transmission). For this example a 1KB buffer is used. // This buffer is going to be used to hold messages as they come in. // You can make this 512 size if memory is tight. static uint8_t s_buffer [ 1024 ]; // create an instance to hold communications state static is_comm_instance_t comm ; Step 3: Serial Port Initialization \u00b6 void setup () { // Initialize both serial ports: Serial . begin ( 115200 ); Serial1 . begin ( 115200 ); if ( sizeof ( double ) != 8 ) { Serial . println ( \"Inertial Sense SDK requires 64 bit double support\" ); while ( true ) { }; } Serial . println ( \"initializing\" ); // Initialize comm interface - call this before doing any comm functions is_comm_init ( & comm , s_buffer , sizeof ( s_buffer )); // Stop all the broadcasts on the device int messageSize = is_comm_stop_broadcasts_all_ports ( & comm ); Serial1 . write ( comm . rxBuf . start , messageSize ); // Transmit the message to the inertialsense device // Ask for ins_1 message 20 times per second. Ask for the whole thing, so // set 0's for the offset and size messageSize = is_comm_get_data_to_buf ( buffer , bufferSize , & comm , DID_INS_1 , sizeof ( ins_1_t ), 0 , 1000 ); Serial1 . write ( comm . rxBuf . start , messageSize ); // Transmit the message to the inertialsense device } Initialize the communication using the following steps as shown above: Initialize the serial ports Tell the communication interface where to find the buffer to use to hold messages, and how big that buffer is. Reset communications on the device Perform configuration of the IMX Tell the IMX what data to stream, and how often Whenever sending a command to the IMX, the command is put into the buffer, and the length of the message is returned by one of the configuration functions. That buffer needs to be written out to the IMX for the command to be received. Tip \u200b It is recommended to use the enumerations in data_sets.h such as SYS_CFG_BITS_RTK_ROVER to configure the device. This aids code readability and reduces the chance for errors. In this example, the DID_INS_1 message is streamed. All available messages can be found in the data_sets.h file, defined as C-style structs. Step 4: Handle Received Data \u00b6 void loop () { // Read from port 1, and see if we have a complete inertialsense packet if ( Serial1 . available ()) { uint8_t inByte = Serial1 . read (); // This function returns the DID of the message that was just parsed, we can then point the buffer to // the right function to handle the message. We can use a cast to interpret the s_buffer as the // kind of message that we received. uint32_t message_type = is_comm_parse_byte ( & comm , inByte ); switch ( message_type ) { case _PTYPE_INERTIAL_SENSE_DATA : switch ( comm . dataHdr . id ) { case DID_NULL : break ; case DID_INS_1 : handleINSMessage (( ins_1_t * )( comm . pkt . data . ptr )); break ; default : Serial . print ( \"Got an unexpected message DID: \" ); Serial . println ( message_type , DEC ); } } } } In this code, every byte that we receive from the IMX is passed to the is_comm_parse function. For each byte received, this function waits for a complete message in the buffer and decodes it. Once a full message is received, it identifies what kind of message is in the buffer so it can be handled correctly. The easiest way to deal with this is to us a case structure as shown above, with separate \"callback\" functions for each message type. The INS message handler is just printing the position in lla, velocity and euler angle attitude to the screen. Other parameterizations of position and attitude are available in other DID_INS_x messages. static void handleINSMessage ( ins_1_t * ins ) { Serial . print ( \"Lat: \" ); Serial . print (( float ) ins -> lla [ 0 ], 6 ); Serial . print ( \" \\t \" ); Serial . print ( \", Lon: \" ); Serial . print (( float ) ins -> lla [ 1 ], 6 ); Serial . print ( \" \\t \" ); Serial . print ( \", Alt: \" ); Serial . print (( float ) ins -> lla [ 2 ], 2 ); Serial . print ( \" \\t \" ); Serial . print ( \", roll: \" ); Serial . print ( ins -> theta [ 0 ] * C_RAD2DEG_F ); Serial . print ( \" \\t \" ); Serial . print ( \", pitch: \" ); Serial . print ( ins -> theta [ 1 ] * C_RAD2DEG_F ); Serial . print ( \" \\t \" ); Serial . print ( \", yaw: \" ); Serial . print ( \" \\t \" ); Serial . println ( ins -> theta [ 2 ] * C_RAD2DEG_F ); }","title":"Comm-Arduino (C)"},{"location":"user-manual/software/SDK/CommunicationsArduino/#basic-arduino-communications-example-project","text":"","title":"Basic Arduino Communications Example Project"},{"location":"user-manual/software/SDK/CommunicationsArduino/#interfacing-with-the-imx-over-serial","text":"This example shows how to communicate with the IMX using the Inertial Sense Binary Communications Protocol .

Data doesn't look right \u00b6 If the EvalTool or SDK are from a different release from the firmware on the unit, there may be communication protocol related issues. It's best to keep both the software and firmware in sync with each other. The EvalTool should flag a protocol mismatch in the settings tab. Bootloader Not Responding \u00b6 Check the following: The input supply is at 3.3V and clean without noise. The serial connection is grounded (no floating grounds). The serial wires between the uINS module and the next active device (buffer, converter, or processor) are not longer than 1 meter when bootloading firmware. Reset or power cycle the IMX and promptly run the firmware update within 30 seconds of reset. A known issue in the IMX-5 bootloader version v6g and prior versions that disables all UARTS if no handshake is received within 50 second following startup. Resetting the IMX will re-enable UARTs for 50 seconds. Bootloader Update fails first time \u00b6 If updating the bootloader firmware and using the USB direct connection on the IMX module (pins 1 and 2) or the EVB-2 (EVB USB connector), the serial port number will change when the device switches from application mode to Bootloader Update mode. This is expected and requires reselecting the new serial port and running the Bootloader Update process a second time. System in AHRS mode despite GPS messages being received \u00b6 If attempting to enter NAV mode but the system reports AHRS despite GPS data beig received, then assure your units are not set to Rover RTK mode. This will override your ability to lock in GPS Nav mode. \"IMX-5 Bricked\" System Recovery \u00b6 Assert chip erase pin high (3.3V) while booting (power cycle or reset) to erase all flash memory and place IMX into ROM bootloader (DFU) mode. Note: the IMX bootloader will timeout and disable all UARTS (not USB) after 30 seconds if the sync handshake is not received. This will render the IMX unresponsive over UART. To prevent this, do not interrupt the standard firmware update process. To recover the IMX, reset the IMX and then re-apply the firmware update within 30 seconds of reset. https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/reference/bootloader/#known-issues Note: Following chip erase: Update firmware using standard procedure including app and bootloader firmware images. Upload IMU calibration. \"GPX and IMX Bricked\" System Recovery \u00b6 Assert boot mode pin high (3.3V) while booting (power cycle or reset) to put the device into bootloader mode. Inertial Sense customer support is required to facilitate bootloader communications with this device. \"uINS Bricked\" System Recovery \u00b6 There are different reasons a system may appear unresponsive and not communicate. The following sections describe how to recover a system from these states. Attention The ONLY indicator that the bootloader is running is the fading cyan module LED. NO communications will appear in the EvalTool or CLTool. Attempt to update the firmware before performing a chip erase . Attention Hardware v3.1.3 and firmware IS_uINS-3_v1.2.1.0_b287_2017-09-17_103826.hex and older will not communicate and require following these instructions to be recovered. Do NOT use the chip erase procedure for this scenario. Stuck in Bootloader Mode \u00b6 In some cases, the bootloader may fail to completely update firmware. This is indicated by the fading cyan status LED on the IMX module. This can happen if older bootloader firmware is on the uINS and firmware version 1.7.1 is uploaded. If this happens, the system will appear to be unresponsive in the EvalTool. The following process can be used to recover the system to a working state: If the bootloader is running , identified with the fading cyan color LED on the uINS module, following these steps: Ensure uINS Firmware is Running - (This step is not necessary if the uINS firmware is running and the EvalTool is communicating with the uINS) . Select the device serial port and update the firmware using 1.6.4 or earlier. If the bootloader is running, version information will not appear in the EvalTool. The following bootloader update step will not work unless the EvalTool is communicating with the uINS firmware. Update the Bootloader - Use the EvalTool \"Update Bootloader\" button in the Settings tab to upload the latest bootloader firmware . If it has a fading cyan color on the uINS module, the bootloader is running and ready for new firmware to be loaded. The bootloader can only be updated using serial0 or the native USB connection. Update the Firmware - Use the EvalTool \"Update Firmware\" button to upload the latest uINS firmware . If neither the bootloader or the uINS firmware are running, identified with the solid or no LED status on the uINS module, please contacts us . Recovery for Firmware v1.2.1.0 \u00b6 Hardware v3.1.3 and newer and firmware IS_uINS-3_v1.2.1.0_b287_2017-09-17_103826.hex and older result in a system that runs but will not communicate properly. This older firmware was not designed for the newer hardware and consequently runs the processor at a slower speed, which alters all of the predefined baud rates to non-standard irregular baud rates. A symptom of this problem is the LED flashing to indicate the processor activity and the module never communicates properly. The following steps are provided to recover communications with the system. Install and run the hotfix release 1.1.3 EvalTool . Select the special baud rate 560,000 in the EvalTool and open the serial port. Update the firmware using any version newer than IS_uINS-3_v1.2.1.0_b287_2017-09-17_103826.hex. The latest EvalTool, CLTool, SDK, and firmware can be used once the firmware has been updated on the module. Troubleshooting with EvalTool \u00b6 Units Not Connecting \u00b6 In the case that your units do not connect properly to the EvalTool, verify: The baud rate is the same that you previously had when the Com Ports last opened correctly. The LED on the unit is not showing solid white, flashing white, or solid red. These mean a failure occured in loading the bootloader (see User Guide for full LED descriptions). If you are using a USB3.0 connection, the com port might take longer to show up than with USB2.0 Check your computer's Device Manager to see if your unit shows up there. If it doesn't show up, you may have an FTDI driver issue. If you suspect you don't have the FTDI driver installed on your Windows computer, use the following links to download the driver: - Executable for the FTDI USB driver: - https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CDM-v2.12.36.4-WHQL-Certified.zip - Drives without executable. - http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm Downgrading uINS to 1.8.x Firmware \u00b6 The following steps can be used to downgrade the uINS firmware to version 1.8.x (or older): Ensure the uINS is running 1.9.x (or newer) firmware. Send the system commands SYS_CMD_MANF_UNLOCK and SYS_CMD_MANF_DOWNGRADE_CALIBRATION to the uINS to downgrade the IMU calibration and put the system into bootloader update mode. This can be done using the EvalTool, cltool, or SDK . EvalTool (version 1.9.1 or later): Use the firmware \" Downgrade \" button (EvalTool -> Settings -> General -> Factory -> Downgrade). cltool (version 1.10 or later): Use option -sysCmd=1357924682 to send the downgrade command: ./cltool -c /dev/ttyACM0 -sysCmd=1357924682 cltool alternate method : use option -edit 7 to edit the DID_SYS_CMD and send the downgrade command: ./cltool -c /dev/ttyACM0 -edit 7 Use w and s to move the cursor up or down (arrow keys do not work) and enter to submit the new value. The invCommand value is the bitwise inverse of the command and is required to validate the command. The command value will change to zero when the IMX accepts the command and invCommand values. Send manufacture unlock command: command = 1122334455 invCommand = 3172632840 Send downgrade command: command = 1357924682 invCommand = 2937042613 Verify the uINS has reboot into bootloader update mode. The host serial port will disappear and reappear. The uINS will NOT support normal DID binary or NMEA communications in this mode, but will be ready to update the bootloader. Update the bootloader and firmware using the 1.8.x EvalTool, cltool, or SDK. Be sure to use the bootloader v5d (or older) with the 1.8.x firmware. Chip Erase Downgrade \u00b6 The above process using the SYS_CMD_MANF_DOWNGRADE_CALIBRATION command is recommended as it prevents the need to reload the IMU calibration onto the uINS. However, an alternative method to downgrade uINS to 1.8.x firmware is as follows: Chip erase the uINS. Load v5b (or older) bootloader and 1.8.x (or older) firmware using the 1.8.x EvalTool, cltool, or SDK. Restore the IMU calibration. 1.7.6 Bug RTK Base GPS Raw work around \u00b6 If you are having base raw errors on your Rover, in the bottom right of the Evaltool, or a climbing Diffrential Age, in Data Sets DID_GPS1_RTK_REL, you maybe having this bug. Try this workaround. Go-to settings tab, open the Base serial COM port. Go-to Data Logs tab, under RCM Presets dropdown select PPD. NOTE: You must leave the comport open on the Base.

Typical Dual GNSS heading fix time is 60-90 seconds using a 1 meter baseline. Baseline distances shorter than 1 meter will impact both heading accuracy and time to fix. However, having a short baseline of 0.35m should not cause an extremely long fix time. ITEM TO TEST: Try increasing the antenna baseline to 0.5m or greater during initial testing. Satellite CNO Strength, RFI and EMI \u00b6 What is the satellite CNO (signal strength) level? The mean CNO would ideally be above 38-40. Anything lower could indicate the presence of RF interference (RFI) or electromagnetic interference (EMI). You can see this in the EvalTool GPS tab or the DID_GPS1_POS message. ITEM TO TEST: Try powering off portions of the system while running the IMX. You may even try running the IMX independently to a separate computer to monitor the system so you can completely power off your system with the IMX still running. Pay close attention to the GPS CNO during each change. USB Interface \u00b6 USB-3 has been known to interfere with wireless and GNSS systems. It is the most common source of interference that has been experienced. Properly shielded cables or signal filters can address this. ITEM TO TEST: Disable USB-3, digital busses, or various switching supplies and observe the satellite CNO level. CNO mean should be near or above 40 dB/Hz. Antenna Ground Planes \u00b6 The ground planes should be adequately sized. Larger ground planes help but are generally not the root cause of poor performance. Separate and common ground planes are both acceptable. ITEM TO TEST: Try doubling the ground plane below the antenna. A simple sheet of metal placed below the antenna is fine. This is also not likely the root cause but worth testing. Antenna Cable Ground Loops \u00b6 In come cases the GNSS antenna cable can form an electrical loop and cause interfere. ITEM TO TEST: Try to ensure cables never loop back or are bundled. If possible shorten cables to smallest required length. Monitor GPS CNO before and after. Local Interference \u00b6 In some cases we have seen object in close proximity to the GNSS antennas act as a multi-path surface, reflect GNSS signals onto the GNSS antennas. Ensure no objects are near the antennas above the plane of the antennas.

You can see this in the EvalTool GPS tab or the DID_GPS1_POS message. ITEM TO TEST: Try powering off portions of the system while running the IMX. You may even try running the IMX independently to a separate computer to monitor the system so you can completely power off your system with the IMX still running. Pay close attention to the GPS CNO during each change.","title":"Satellite CNO Strength, RFI and EMI"},{"location":"user-manual/troubleshooting/gnss/#usb-interface","text":"USB-3 has been known to interfere with wireless and GNSS systems. It is the most common source of interference that has been experienced. Properly shielded cables or signal filters can address this.

CNO mean should be near or above 40 dB/Hz.","title":"USB Interface"},{"location":"user-manual/troubleshooting/gnss/#antenna-ground-planes","text":"The ground planes should be adequately sized. Larger ground planes help but are generally not the root cause of poor performance. Separate and common ground planes are both acceptable.

The following instructions show how to install the correct device driver using the Zadig generic USB driver installer Windows application. Steps to Update IMX Windows Device Driver \u00b6 When updating the bootloader, the IMX-5 will switch into ROM bootloader mode and communicate using DFU protocol over USB. In this mode the device is identified in the Window Device Manager as STM32 BOOTLOADER . This device will only appear in the Device Manager when the IMX-5 is in ROM bootloader mode and connected via USB. This device will not appear in the Device Manager during normal operation or when not connected over USB. STEP 1 - Uninstall Old Device Driver - To uninstall the device driver, right click and select \"Uninstall device\" on the STM32 BOOTLOADER device. NOTE: To see the device in the device manager, the IMX-5 should be connected over USB and the IMX-5 in ROM bootloader mode. Run the firmware update with bootloader Force Update option to enable ROM bootloader mode on the IMX-5. NOTE: An incorrect version of the device driver can be identified when the STM32 BOOTLOADER device appears under Universal Serial Bus Controllers . The correct device driver will cause the STM32 BOOTLOADER device to appear under Universal Serial Bus Devices . Delete the old device driver files by selecting Attempt to remove the driver for this device or Delete driver files checkbox and click Uninstall . STEP 2 - Install New Device Driver - Download and run the Zadig USB driver installer . The Zadig USB driver installer detects the device that needs the driver installed. The STM32 BOOTLOADER device must appear in the Windows Device Manager for this to work. When there is no device driver installed, the STM32 BOOTLOADER device will appear under Other devices in the Windows Device Manager. Run the Zadig generic USB driver application. Select update online and make sure STM32 BOOTLOADER is selected in the top dropdown menu. WinUSB *=*v(6.1... should appear in the driver option list. Click Install Driver and wait about one minute for the process to finish. The STM32 BOOTLOADER device will appear in the Device Manager under Universal Serial Bus devices when the device driver is properly installed. Run the firmware update to test the newly installed device driver. NOTE: The negotiation at the beginning of the IMX-5 bootloader update can be interrupted if the IMX-5 receives data on other ports than that used for the update (i.e. from a connected GPS receiver). If this happens, the firmware update will fail but can be re-run. To prevent interruption so that the bootloader update occurs in one process, data stream into other ports of the IMX must be turned off.","title":"IMX Bootloader"},{"location":"user-manual/troubleshooting/imx_bootloader/#imx-5-bootloader","text":"","title":"IMX-5 Bootloader"},{"location":"user-manual/troubleshooting/imx_bootloader/#windows-usb-device-driver","text":"In some cases updating the IMX-5 bootloader firmware (not the IMX-5 application firmware) will fail in Windows if the wrong device driver is used.
